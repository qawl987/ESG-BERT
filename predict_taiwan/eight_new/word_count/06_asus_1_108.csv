According to the 2022 Circularity Gap Report the world population has doubled from 1972 to 2021 and the annual consumption of,24,26,diff,empty,,
virgin materials has surged from 286 billion tons to 1014 billion tons worldwide which is a 35fold increase in the last 50 years The,19,26,diff,empty,,
global consumption of virgin materials will be over 100 billion tons each year and only 86 of the resources are being recycled and,15,26,diff,empty,,
reused In the past industries have adopted the linear economic model of takemakedispose which has led to a significant increase of,4,26,diff,empty,,
waste The lack of balance from such actions can imply that the growth will invariably reach the limit of space and resources at a certain,4,4,,,,
time thus creating the paradox of shortage of resources and waste in the society today The rapid replacement of electronic products,19,19,,,,
has exacerbated this issue ASUS believes that if we do not change this production and consumption model we would be unable to,24,26,diff,empty,,
provide a sustainable future to the next generation and the shortage of resources and fluctuating value will also create operational risks,18,24,diff,,,
ASUS has adopted the circular economy approach for sustainable development to transition from passive pollution prevention to active,23,4,diff,,,
prevention and regeneration We refuse to use toxic chemical substances that cannot be reused and extend the life cycle of products,19,9,diff,,,
from cradle to grave to cradle to cradle by redesigning materials products processes and business models Through the cycle of,15,26,diff,empty,,
makeusereturn we maximize the efficiency of resource use and create new business models which will gradually evolve into the core,24,20,diff,,,
Monitor the results and implement continuous improvement based on the ASUS 2025 Sustainability Goals,3,0,diff,,,
Incorporate the circular economy policy in all stages of the product life cycle to reduce the environmental product footprint Produce,15,9,diff,,,
products with environmentally friendly materials low energy consumption and designs for easy disassembly and recycling In order to,15,19,diff,,,
expand the revenue share of green and safe products and create benefits for the environment product users and corporate operations,15,4,diff,,,
The circular economy model helps reduce the excessive waste of resources and environmental pollution and supports an environmentally friendly business model To attain this goal we incorporated,15,19,diff,,,
the circular economy concept into the design of products and services We use the four following procedures to support the five business models proposed by the international consulting firm,15,26,diff,empty,,
Accenture Circular Supply chain Product Life Extension Products as a Service PaaS sharing Platform and Recovery and Recycling We incorporated the circular economy strategy into our basic,15,19,diff,,,

Environmentally friendly materials Chemical substance management Reduce virgin materials,15,11,diff,,,
High energy efficiency Easy to disassemble design Lightweight product,24,24,,,,
With the increasing environmental impacts of global warming and climate change ASUS has paid more attention to the environmental impact of the product life cycle while creating product value,15,9,diff,,,
We follow the standards of ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 Life Cycle Assessment to quantify their potential impact on the environment We identify opportunities for making improvement in the product,15,10,diff,,,
life cycle based on the aforementioned LCA assessment results We then redesign products processes and services and improve product repairability refurbishment and reuse to ensure more,15,10,diff,,,
efficient reuse of nextgeneration products and resources and continue to track and reduce consumption,15,19,diff,,,
In terms of the carbon footprint in the product life cycle we incorporated the circular economy concept into the design of products and services as the carbon reduction issue becomes more critical,15,25,diff,,,
for the international community We use environmentally friendly materials increase energy efficiency extend the use cycle and develop lowcarbon products,15,24,diff,,,
For instance the carbon footprint analysis report for the ASUS laptop ExpertBook B9 showed that 59 of the product carbon footprint is attributed to the manufacturing process while 27 comes,15,24,diff,,,
from product use ASUS has expanded its use of ecofriendly materials and set the improvement of product energy efficiency as its main goal Therefore ASUS has been using certified materials by,15,24,diff,,,
the Forest Stewardship Council FSC for the packaging of ExpertBook B9 and its energy efficiency outperforms the latest version of the US Energy Star standard by 54 thus reducing the overall,24,24,,,,
carbon emissions in product use to under 30,25,21,diff,,,
ASUS identifies the hot spots for emissions in the product life cycle and continues to track and reduce the carbon footprint of products,15,25,diff,,,
More than 80 of environmental impacts in the product life cycle is determined in the design phase We believe that integrating the concept of circular economy into the product design phase,15,9,diff,,,
introducing environmentally friendly design and more active management on the use of chemicals in the production process can improve the recycling and reuse of products and substances,15,19,diff,,,
Numerous chemicals would be added to the product to ensure quality and safety Along with advancing analysis on scientific hazards and risks however some chemicals that are currently approved,14,6,diff,,,
for use may be determined as necessary to control in the future which could interrupt the circularity of the products or components The use of safer chemicals will help the circulation of resources,15,14,diff,,,
and reduce environmental pollutions at the end of the products life cycle and create a safer disposal process to protect the personnel,15,9,diff,,,
ASUS has introduced ISO 9001 Quality Management System since 1999 supplemented by IECQ QC 080000 Hazardous Substance Process Management System Requirements for chemical,19,11,diff,,,
management Through the thirdparty testing laboratory the onsite audit performed by ASUS personnel the audit and reaudit of the management system and else the development of the entire,0,11,diff,,,

Management of Packaging Materials and Substances used in the,15,11,diff,,,
In recent years plastic pollutions has attracted the most attention ASUS approach is to improve,19,26,diff,empty,,
the recyclability of plastics and one of the key elements is the flame retardants In order to,15,26,diff,empty,,
International regulations on hazardous substances change rapidly With regard to the,19,19,,,,
protect users and improve the fire resistance characteristics of the product flame retardants are,24,26,diff,empty,,
packaging materials that come into direct contact with consumers we require them to meet,15,14,diff,,,
added to the plastics of electronic products Among them halogen flame retardants have the,15,26,diff,empty,,
the EU Directive 9462EC on packaging and packaging waste PPWD In 2021 we also required,19,14,diff,,,
advantages of wide application fields and high flame retardant efficiency which are the main,24,20,diff,,,
suppliers not to use mineral oil as printing materials and imposed additional restrictions on the,17,26,diff,empty,,
reasons for their widespread use However it has been confirmed internationally that halogen,24,26,diff,empty,,
use of Phthalates and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons PFAs ASUS actively manages current,25,26,diff,empty,,
flame retardants will produce extremely toxic dioxin which is harmful to the environment and,19,26,diff,empty,,
and future international standards for hazardous substances and reduces the environmental,19,9,diff,,,
human health if improperly recycled and processed and the parts containing halogen cannot,19,6,diff,,,
hazardous factors that come in direct contact with humans,19,19,,,,
In addition to controlling hazardous substances in products ASUS cares about whether the,19,19,,,,
ASUS is committed to continuously reduce the use of halogen flame retardants when,24,26,diff,empty,,
materials or auxiliaries used in the manufacturing process might cause potential danger to the,15,15,,,,
technically and economically feasible provided that the performance and quality of products,15,6,diff,,,
production line workers and the environment Moreover ASUS controls the use of benzene and,24,26,diff,empty,,
remain unaffected Since we adopting a halogenfree policy policy in 2010 we have gradually,12,12,,,,
nhexane in the cleaning and decontamination solutions in the manufacturing process ASUS,19,15,diff,,,
transitioned to halogenfree hard drives and batteries in 2019 and PCBs in 2021 The use of,24,26,diff,empty,,
has gradually introduced lowVOCs Volatile Organic Compounds raw materials such as paint,6,26,diff,empty,,
halogen flame retardants will be banned for more components and products in the future,15,26,diff,empty,,
and ink since 2020 To reduce the factors in manufacturing processes that are likely to affect the,15,15,,,,
In terms of the management of halogen substances ASUS has banned the use of chlorine in the,6,11,diff,,,
bleaching process for paper packaging since 2018 and gradually phased out PVC in the TypeC,15,14,diff,,,
charging cables for the nextgeneration mobile communication products in 2020 We also,24,8,diff,,,
banned to use halogen flame retardants for the plastic external cases of electronic products in,15,26,diff,empty,,
2017 before regulatory requirements were implemented 851 of the products shipped in 2021,15,26,diff,empty,,
meet the ASUS HalogenFree Regulation and we continue to advance toward higher goals,12,9,diff,,,
Due to the advanced preparation for the management of chemical substances ASUS has,19,11,diff,,,
obtained environmental tax credits and has accumulated more than US64 million in,12,9,diff,,,
environmental tax credits in Sweden since 2017 It proves that we can contribute to the,12,9,diff,,,
environment and reap benefits by enhancing the competitiveness of green products,4,11,diff,,,
human body or indirectly cause environmental hazards ASUS continues to ban all substances in,19,9,diff,,,
the US Toxic Substance Control Act TSCA and fulfill social responsibilities,19,10,diff,,,
In the past we frequently conducted surveys on supply chain and product with the passive response to,17,5,diff,,,
international regulations or customer requests We have gradually moved towards active substance management,12,11,diff,,,
since 2018 by adapting the Full Material Disclosure FMD program By investigating all materials used from the,19,12,diff,,,
source to the assembly line we could analyze the data and evaluate the risks of using materials,17,22,diff,,,
FMD Full Material Disclosure is the method of enhancing the transparency of the chemical supply chain in the,17,12,diff,,,
production process ASUS works with the supply chain and prioritizes the FMD of mainstream products We must,15,26,diff,empty,,
work more closely with suppliers and upstream parts of the supply chain to implement FMD ASUS helps suppliers,17,26,diff,empty,,
create operating procedures for substances in the plants We also use ASUSs current material management system,19,11,diff,,,
with FMD inventory operations The current FMD response rate is over 90,24,5,diff,,,
Take the laptop as an example With FMD we learn that it uses more than 300 chemical substances which can be,16,26,diff,empty,,
classified into plastic about 381 metal about 289 glass about 113 and other ingredients about 217,16,26,diff,empty,,
During the analysis process highrisk substances can be immediately identified and resources can be concentrated,19,4,diff,,,
to look for alternative materials to ensure environmental and social safety,15,9,diff,,,
ASUS shifts to an active substance management approach with which we can accurately grasp the information of,6,11,diff,,,
chemicals used in products and make chemical usage data the most valuable intellectual property of ASUS The,15,14,diff,,,
data will help ASUS to expand the management scope to upstream immediately manage the risk in materials and,18,11,diff,,,
respond to the government policy and environmental regulations worldwide more quickly and more effectively,12,9,diff,,,
For example the EUs updated Waste Framework Directive WFD requires products with SVHC substances of,19,19,,,,
very high concern content higher than 01 to complete the reporting of the SCIP Substances of Concern In,19,26,diff,empty,,
articles as such or in complex objects Products by January 5 2021 to effectively monitor materials in the supply,15,26,diff,empty,,
chain Before the enforcement of the Directive ASUS had completed the submission of all products so that we are,15,12,diff,,,
well prepared for frequent updates of the list,12,26,diff,empty,,
In addition to improving the recyclability of resources we are also gradually applying sustainable materials,15,26,diff,empty,,
in the products The Plastic Climate The Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet report published by the Center,19,25,diff,,,
for International Environmental Law CIEL estimated that plastic products would grow at an annual speed,15,9,diff,,,
of 35 before 2050 With such speed 28 Gt of CO2e will be discharged in 2050 which is equivalent to the total emissions of 615 500MW coalfired power plants,25,21,diff,,,
Among ASUS products mainstream products contain more than 30 plastic of total weight which,15,26,diff,empty,,
accounts for the largest amount of materials used Therefore we cooperate with the suppliers to explore,17,26,diff,empty,,
the opportunities that increase the use of postconsumer recycled PCR plastic as much as possible without,15,26,diff,empty,,
compromising quality function and durability The average PCR plastic content of ASUS business laptops,15,6,diff,,,
is 5 Moreover ASUS developed PCR plastic with antibacterial functions by applying our innovative RD,6,26,diff,empty,,
skills Since 2017 we have used more than 1064 tons of PCR plastic and reduced carbon emissions by 1915 tons CO2e2 In the future ASUS will continue to expand the use of sustainable materials in products and take real actions to support the circular economy and sustainability in the future,15,21,diff,,,
According to the WEF and research report from Ellen MacArthur Foundation in 2016 most of the packaging,15,4,diff,,,
was only used once where the massive plastic junk produced after use was only recycled effectively at a,19,26,diff,empty,,
Starting from 2019 ASUS has replaced PE bags with PET nonwoven fabric We increased the use of recycled,15,26,diff,empty,,
pulp for the paper packaging of certain products to 90 Approximately 20670 tons of recycled paper was,15,14,diff,,,
used for main products in 2021 which was an increase of 20 on 2020 In terms of resource protection,15,6,diff,,,
and the ecology ASUS has started to use paper materials certified by the Forest Stewardship Council FSC,23,7,diff,,,
since 2020 We used 20 tons in 2021 which was almost double the amount used in 2020 We will continue to,24,26,diff,empty,,
In addition under the premise of maintaining safe transportation we reduce the waste of the internal,19,17,diff,,,
space of the packaging and the packaging volume to decrease the use of materials We also consider the,15,14,diff,,,
way of stacking It not only could improve transportation efficiency but also could prevent damage caused,24,17,diff,,,

laptops packaging contains more than 90 recycled pulp and more,15,14,diff,,,
ASUS uses a simple design concept to create a professional display hood that can be easily,15,26,diff,empty,,
than 95 of the materials for the box is paperbased which reduces,15,26,diff,empty,,
