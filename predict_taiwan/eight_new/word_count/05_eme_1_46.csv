eMemorys business model is different from the typical business model of our peers It is based on,3,26,diff,empty,,
a triangular relationship between design houses the foundries and ourselves,4,26,diff,empty,,
When eMemory licenses its technology to a foundry the foundry partner then pays a license fee for,12,26,diff,empty,,
the technical setup and license grant For design houses either a usage fee or NRE fee is collected,12,26,diff,empty,,
when a complete design is licensed Technology license fees usage fees and NRE fees are all,12,26,diff,empty,,
categorized as upfront fees by eMemory Later when a product is tapedout or massproduced,15,26,diff,empty,,
eMemory receives running royalties from our foundry partners based on the contractually agreed,12,26,diff,empty,,
This business model creates a much closer and sustainable collaboration among all three parties and,3,8,diff,,,
allows eMemory to take an active role in supporting product development to completion On the,15,4,diff,,,
foundry side we are a memory technology provider with the design houses we license our macro,1,26,diff,empty,,
block design and for both we offer technical support With our technologies and macro designs,15,26,diff,empty,,
our partners can further design energyefficient and costefficient chips to be utilized across a broad range of markets,15,25,diff,,,

Since eMemory does not operate factories of any sort we do not have direct GHG emissions Scope,25,21,diff,,,
1 The main source of GHG emissions is indirect GHG emissions Scope 2 which are associated with,25,21,diff,,,
the purchase of electricity from Taiwan Power Company In 2021 the total carbon dioxide emission,21,21,,,,
was 690112kg with 23394 kg of average emission per capita which is a reduction of 28 from,21,19,diff,,,
2407 kg in 2020 The emission of carbon dioxide is expected to reach 2300 kg per capita by 2022,25,21,diff,,,
which we have almost achieved and will work toward it,12,26,diff,empty,,
We use water in our daily operations for food services and sanitation The main water sources are,20,20,,,,
the Touqian River and Baoshan Reservoir The total water consumption in 2021 was 3372 kL with,20,20,,,,

eMemory supports energy conservation and environmental protection by continuing to develop,23,9,diff,,,
advanced semiconductor process technologies that support our customers designs Collaboratively,15,26,diff,empty,,
our customers can thereby produce the most advanced energyefficient and environmental,15,9,diff,,,
friendly products possible With advances in the semiconductor manufacturing process and the,15,15,,,,
increasing complexity of IC design our IPs can be used to enhance the efficiency of the IC design,15,20,diff,,,
process and shorten development time As the process nodes evolve not only is the chip size,3,4,diff,,,
significantly reduced but the power consumption of each type of chip is effectively reduced,24,26,diff,empty,,
Take display driver ICs DDI for example which is one of the applications with the largest shipments,24,26,diff,empty,,
among various products embedded with our IPs The main demand for DDI covers from 035m High,15,4,diff,,,
Voltage Process HV to 28nm HV Each generation of the HV process saves 5070 of power,24,24,,,,
consumption compared to the previous generation As the process advances the power saving rate,24,24,,,,
is reduced to 3050 Based on these power consumption characteristics it is conservatively,24,26,diff,empty,,
estimated that the average power saving rate of DDI chips embedded with eMemorys IP was 136,24,26,diff,empty,,
Based on the wafer shipments of major products in 2021 we helped to reduce the electricity,15,26,diff,empty,,
consumption of the enduse products with our IPs up to 390 million kWh which is equivalent to,15,26,diff,empty,,
195000 tons of CO2 emissions equivalent to the carbon absorption capacity of 430 New York Central Park,25,21,diff,,,
Moreover eMemorys IP can improve the stability and yield of the wafers and further reduce,4,26,diff,empty,,
resource consumption during wafer manufacturing During the fabrication and packaging stages the,17,14,diff,,,
trimming function of eMemorys IP can be used to meet the required product specifications thereby,15,26,diff,empty,,
reducing the cost of wafer remanufacturing Based on the wafer shipment in 2021 eMemory,24,15,diff,,,
contributed to saving nearly NT160 billion in manufacturing costs and reduced 253 billion kilowatt,24,15,diff,,,
hours of electricity usage and 12 million cubic meters of water consumption equivalent to the,20,20,,,,
carbon adsorption of nearly 2800 New York Central Park and the water consumption of 4867,20,20,,,,
In addition our PUFbased solutions can help to reduce and recycle electronic waste ewaste,19,19,,,,
throughout the product lifecycle Nowadays with various electronic devices being manufactured e,15,26,diff,empty,,
waste has become another vital environmental issue Discarded ewaste could cause public health,19,9,diff,,,
and environmental concerns and security breaches without proper disposal Our PUFbased IPs,1,9,diff,,,
provide each chipdevice with its own unique identity and root of trust which strengthens product,3,26,diff,empty,,
and application security It prolongs the product lifecycle and prevents the chipdevice from,15,22,diff,,,
becoming ewaste due to a lack of security protection During the decommissioning phase we can,1,6,diff,,,
also easily track the discarded products by their unique IDs to properly recycle and decommission,15,26,diff,empty,,
the products which further prevents the ecosystem from being hacked,1,23,diff,,,
