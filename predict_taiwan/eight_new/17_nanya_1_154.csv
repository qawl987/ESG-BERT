Summarizing the supply and demand information above we expect that the market condition in the second quarter of 2022 will continue the slight pull back in the first quarter but has the opportunity to gradually improve each quarter thereafter It is still necessary to monitor inflation the war between Russia and Ukraine the pandemic and material shortages in the supply chain,17
Looking ahead to 2022 we are cautiously optimistic about the DRAM market and expect the industry to grow,3
Digital transformation stimulates the mid to longterm demand growth of cloud computing Expect the demands for servers from hyperscale data centers continue to grow steadily in 2022 In addition the demand of edge computing emerges as the new driving force of server market and will evolve and develop with the deployment of 5G infrastructure,4
DRAM demands rise from cloud hyperscalers continuous investment in infrastructure of new data centers and the launch of new computer processors Also DRAM content per server will keep growing along with new server CPU using DDR5 to fulfill high bandwidth low latency and high performance required by 5G and AI Expect the launch of new CPU coming shortly in the later part of 2022,1
Global smartphone shipments declined drastically in 2021 due to the COVID19 pandemic 5G smartphone shipment continues to gain share in 2022 and pushes up the DRAM content to grow However the macro uncertainties such as inflation geopolitics and supply disruptions are the key factors to drag down the demand recovery The mainstream of DRAM content per mobile phone will stay at the level of 68GB in 2022 Other than Android camp Apple iPhone will follow the demand trend to adopt 6GB in its flagship models,17
Workfromhome demand enabled the sequential sales growth of consumer PC in 2021 Turing to 2022 PC demand begins to shift from consumer to commercial and gaming PCs instead However macro uncertainties are still the major concern for further growth,4
Sales of consumer electronics in 2022 will be another year to grow steadily backed up by the solid demand from new game consoles video streaming devices smart watches networking equipment video and surveillance systems solid state drives automotive and industrial devices etc In parallel Metaverse is still under development starting from 2022 Business opportunities not limited to VR HMDs HeadMounted Displays AR Augmented Reality smart glasses gaming consoles are emerging in the very initial stage More potential applications and business models are expected to come in the future,15

Due to the effect of global climate change rainfall has become polarized in Taiwan resulting in floods and water shortages occurring at the same time As an important member of the semiconductor industry Nanya has monitored the risk of water shortage caused by global climate change and understands the effect of climate change and water resources on operations Nanya continues to implement water conservation measures and strives to recycle and reuse water to reduce its impact on the environment and the risk of water shortage Our efforts in water resource management has gained the recognition of the CDP an international environmental evaluation indicator Nanya was ranked at the leadership level A in Water Security for two consecutive years recognizing our efforts in climate change and water resource management for global sustainability,20
Nanyas main strategies for water resource management are as follows,20
Actively manage indicators conserve water in operations and fully utilize water resources,20
Assess the risks and opportunities under climate change and mitigate the impact of water shortage,13
Communicate with stakeholders so that they will take water resources seriously and implement water conservation,20
Implement wastewater classification treatment and multiple recycling measures to maximize the efficiency water resources,20
Comply with laws and regulations continue to strengthen water treatment facilities and reduce the risk of environmental pollution,20
Nanyas total water withdrawal was 3456524 million liters in 2021 in which Taoyuan Canal is the main source of water accounting for approximately 988 3416848 million liters followed by tap water at approximately 08 27318 million liters and rainwater at approximately 04 12358 million liters Our production capacity in 2021 increased 03 compared to 2020 and the continued installation of advanced processes led to an increase in total water withdrawal of 23 compared to 2020 In terms of water use intensity water consumption per unit production capacity was 308 metric tonsthousand die in 2021 increase 23 compared to 2020 and water consumption per unit revenue was 404 metric tonsNT1 million decrease 269 compared to 2020 Ultrapure water consumption for the year was 3517009 million liters in 2021 increase 296 compared to 2020 ultrapure water consumption per unit production capacity was 313 metric tonsthousand die increase 26 compared to 2020 and ultrapure water consumption per unit revenue was 411 metric tonsNT1 million decrease 266 compared to 2020,20

Our main water source comes from the Shihmen Reservoir and is channeled and processed through the Taoyuan Canal before being supplied as production water The gravity flow is used to independently channel water without affecting the ecology of water resources and any other purposes of usage In addition rainwater harvesting can supply production water and tap water for household use Currently Nanya has only one production plant located in New Taipei City Taiwan Taiwans rainfall is unevenly distributed between regions and seasons which often results in regional and seasonal droughts Nanya has used the WRI Aqueduct tools for simulating water resource scenarios to analyze the geographical location of the plant The water source is the Taoyuan Canal of Shihmen Reservoir which supplies 965 of water The water stress assessment result was low meaning that it is a nonwater stress area Furthermore Nanyas water source Shihmen Reservoir supplies approximately 800 million littersday The Companys daily water consumption is approximately 95 million litters Hence the effect of Nanyas operations on regional water use is 12,20
To reduce the risk of shortterm water shortages inherent in the geographical location we have continuously promoted watersaving measures and committed ourselves to water recycling to strengthen our adaptability The amount of water needed by production is huge so water shortage will cause production interruptions affecting the output and delivery To mitigate immediate impacts caused by shortterm water shortages a cistern with a capacity of 43 million litters and two detention basins each with a capacity of 406 million litters have been built in the plant to effectively harvest rainwater during the rainy season Moreover Nanya and the adjacent factories of the Formosa Plastics Group have cooperated to set up an emergency response organization for water shortages When water shortages occur the members of the emergency response organization can urgently deploy water resources to support each other Therefore no production losses have occurred owing to water shortages,20
Nanya response measures Water is normally drawn from Taoyuan Canal for production,20

Attend meetings and coordinate and communicate with the Irrigation Agency and North Region Water Resources Office and cooperate with the governments emergency response plan when there is a water shortage in order to most effectively utilize water resources mitigate the impact of water shortages in water supply areas and achieve stable and balanced water supply,20
Nanya formed an Environmental Quality Supervision Committee with the local community when it was first established and commissions a third party to conduct surveys of surrounding ecology hydrology and air quality Survey results are reported to the Environmental Quality Supervision Committee Nanya learns about issues that community residents are concerned about through the Environmental Quality Supervision Committee and includes the issues in its periodic evaluation of ISO 14001 Management Systems To ensure that the water quality of effluent is normal and eliminate concerns residents may have about effluents from Nanya we have established an effluent water quality realtime monitoring system that is linked to the Environmental Protection Bureau jointly monitoring the water quality of effluents in real time,20
Nanya actively implements water conservation measures and plants currently have acidalkaline waste water hydrofluoric waste water and organic waste water recovery systems Along with the implementation of various water saving measures the process water recycling rate reached 908 in 2021 In 2021 the water consumption from waste water and rainfall harvesting methods totaled 5450 million liters accounting for 159 of the companys water consumption In the future to coordinate with the expansion plan of plant area an estimate of NT430 million has been invested in building new hydrofluoric waste water COD and total nitrogen treatment systems which not only will solve the problem of excessively high hydrofluoric waste water COD and total nitrogen but also recover the hydrofluoric waste water at the same time It is estimated that additional 1 million liters hydrofluoric waste water will be recovered daily The systems are expected to be completed in 2022,19
Nanyas process water recovery rate was calculated using the formula approved by Nanlin Technology Park Environmental Quality Supervision and Management Committee which was required in the environmental impact assessment We began using the formula of Hsinchu Science Park Bureau for calculation in 2021 so that calculation standards are consistent with peers in the industry and also updated process water recycling rate in 20182020,20
We share exchange and provide guidance to suppliers for water management and conservation measures through supplier meetings in order to improve their water management measures,20
Nanya shares its water management experience through participation in various events such as the green factory visit coorganized with the Industrial Development Bureau in 2021 during which we shared our water management and water conservation results with visiting government officials and companies,20
Nanya regularly reviews the rationality and appropriateness of raw material use Moreover we reduced the use of raw materials by streamlining the manufacturing process The responsible organization of the company set implementation goals for raw material reductions every year and periodically reviewed the performance of reductions in the entire companys raw materials Accumulative 38 entries in improvement proposals regarding the consumption of raw materials were completed in 2021 including formula development of new processes reductions of process time extensions to use cycle and reductions of process consumption Among improvement plans in 2021 the thin film area used the same raw materials to integrate different processes and effectively improved the efficiency of raw material use the greatest benefits were from reducing the use of SOD Spin on Dielectric by approximately 20L 9 and cleaning solution HC100 by approximately 1000L 7 each month,15

Improvement results Reduced the number of times gas cylinders are replaced each month by 3 times and reduced monthly ZyALD consumption by approximately 55,24
Photoresist consumption improvement The nozzle needs to be cleaned every hour to prevent photoresist crystals from clogging the nozzle,24
Improvement method Adjust the photoresist nozzle cleaning formula to extend the cleaning cycle,19
Improvement results Saved 100L of photoresist each month and saved 4700L of cleaning solution each month,24
Ratio of using recycled materials as production materials,15
During the production process dummy wafers were required to monitor process conditions and used dummy wafers were reused through refabrication Each dummy wafer was expected to be reused for around 811 times differences exist owing to various processes Therefore the cost of purchasing brandnew dummy wafers was saved while plenty of waste output was reduced,19
Since 2017 we have used suppliers supplementing yields as major indicators for the allocation percentage of orders of the next year In addition to considering suppliers quotations wafers of high supplementing yields may enhance the quantities of supplementing wafers and may further improve the percentage of wafer start capacity using reclaim wafer,17
We periodically reviewed defective items with suppliers and asked suppliers improve their process conditions and modify specifications In 2020 suppliers adjusted process methods so the discard condition that etching numbers of wafers were incorrectly read after step rings were polished was improved This increased the average supplementing yield from 80 to 85 and recycling rate increased from 72 in 2017 to 78 in 2020 and further to 80 in 2021 due to the stability of supplementing yield,17
Product testing and reclamation of delivery packaging materials,15
Packaging materials for product shipments to outsourced testing facilities or packaging facilities such as cartons outer cartons cushioning materials and wafer cassettes were all reclaimed as many as possible to be reused within the company Moreover wafer cassettes used by raw material for wafer were also recycled and reused in product shipments and the reuse rate of these cassettes were nearly 100 The aforementioned practices reduced the consumption of product packaging materials and waste output to minimum levels This approach could reduce the consumption of approximate 21000 pieces of brandnew 12inch wafer cassettes every year equivalent to reducing the consumption of 97 metric tons of plastics,19
In response to the action of recycling and reductions the companys own warehouses of finished products started with recyclable packaging materials Reusable packaging materials used in supplementing finished products were recycled to be used in product exchanges for customer complaints product storage and commissioned work to reduce the times of application and purchase further achieving the action of recycling for reuse and reductions of packaging materials In addition the cost of packaging materials used could be reduced Although the saved amount was small it made a difference to overall environmental maintenance and resource recycling,15
Nanya outsources the disposal of 100 of the waste it generates The waste is processed into industrial raw materials construction materials or other raw materials including usage as fuel for incinerators The percentage of waste generated by Nanya that was recycled in 2021 reached 949 in which 907 of general waste was recycled and 965 of hazardous waste was recycled,19

Nanyas main production location is in Taishan Nanlin Science Park which is on a lowaltitude hill Most trees in the area were artificially planted for landscaping and the forests in surrounding areas are mainly secondary and not primary There are no habitats being protected or rehabilitated where the factory is located and in surrounding areas Even so the Company still attaches great importance to ecological resources in surrounding areas and conducts thorough investigation and impact assessments of the surrounding ecological environment in the development and operations of its factory We also proposed mitigation and avoidance strategies in order to avoid and reduce the potential impact of development and operations on biodiversity,23
Nanya has made the following six commitments to protect ecological resources in its operations and supply chain,23
Nanya set performance indicators and goals for the Company and suppliers under the commitment to ecological resource protection in hopes of having a greater positive influence on biodiversity in the overall value chain,23
Starting in 2030 the Companys existing operating activities achieve no net loss NNL and zero deforestation,23
Work together with external partners and tier one and nontier one suppliers in fulfilling this commitment,17
Commitment to avoid operating activities in globally or nationally important biodiversity locations or its near sites,23
Starting in 2035 all of the Companys operating activities achieve a net positive impact NPI,3
The Companys tier one and nontier one key suppliers achieve NNL,17
Periodically conduct ecological surveys and impact assessments of the surrounding areas of operating activities,23
If surrounding areas of existing operating activities are identified as critical biodiversity areas we have an application of mitigation hierarchy avoid minimize restore and offset,23
Starting in 2040 the Companys tier one and nontier one key suppliers will achieve NPI and zero deforestation,23
If current operating activities or products and services provided by the Company involve deforestation we have made a commitment to compensate with future reforestation and terminate any form of development in the future,15
Commitment for operating activities and the products and services provided by the Company to comply with zero deforestation standards and supervise compliance with regulations through the internal environmental management system,14
Nanya will disclose the naturerelated risks and coping measures through four major steps Locate Evaluate Asses and Prepare which is based on the structure of TNFD Taskforce on Naturerelated Financial Disclosures TNFD Nanaya have finished step 1Locate and 2Evaluate and will step by step to achieve the goal of NNL by 2030,18
Nanya applies the mitigation hierarchy to manage and mitigate its impact on biodiversity and ecosystems The mitigation hierarchy includes avoid minimize restore and offset Avoid and minimize are the Companys most important measures For example the Company has analyzed the impact of the new factory development plan on surrounding plant ecology habitats and water environment and taken measures to avoid and mitigate impact If operations or development will still damage the ecosystem after taking measures to avoid and mitigate impact the Company will take restore measures in the damaged areas and will take compensate measures eg forestation setting up an environmental trust fund and transferring it to the government or nonprofit organizations to improve or restore the environment if restore measures still cannot reduce losses in order to compensate for the impact on biodiversity,23
Nanya periodically checks if its operating activities comply with zero deforestation through the Sustainable Development Committee the current main production location is 100 comply with zero deforestation We also monitor operating activities and products supplied by suppliers through the sustainable supply chain management platform so that they comply with the Companys commitment to zero deforestation The Company also complies with international forestry regulations and includes certifications of international institutions eg Forest Stewardship Council FSC into evaluation standards for prioritizing suppliers,17
Plants in some construction areas were removed and result in a decrease in population The construction causes dust to cover the surface of leaves and may result in poor plant growth,23
Traffic flow causes dust to cover the surface of leaves and may result in poor plant growth,23
Plan the route of transportation vehicles in advance and ensure that the vehicles transport gravel and heavy machinery according to the route to limit the area affected by dust Vehicles used to transport gravel must be covered by canvas or dust cloth,19
Plant native or endemic plants in the form of a multiple layered forest When transportation vehicles enter and exit the construction site they must first go through a washing station to reduce dust Cover gravel with canvas or dust cloth during temporary storage so as to prevent dust and the growth of invasive plants Water plants on both sides of the planned route to reduce the impact of dust on plant growth,23
Disturbance from noise and vibrations nighttime lighting construction vehicles personnel activities and waste impact the original habitat and land animals active in the construction area,23
Domestic waste generated by construction workers must be collected in a covered storage facility or properly wrapped and disposed of in order to prevent it from being eaten by wild animals or causing secondary damages due to spilling in the transportation process Avoid using vehicles in poor condition that generate high noise The use of chemical agents is prohibited and manual grass cutting and rat traps are used for environmental protection in order to poisoning and killing wild animals,19
There was no significant impact on surrounding animals during the operation period,23
Low landscape fixtures are used to limit the range of lighting for trails automatic sensors are installed and a timer is set to turn of the lights at night reducing the disturbance caused by light to nocturnal animals,23
If wastewater with relatively high sand content or domestic wastewater generated by construction personnel is directly discharged into nearby water bodies it will contaminate the water,20
If wastewater and waste is directly discharged or disposed near water bodies it will impact the water ecology of surrounding areas,20
Construction waste water is prohibited from being discharged into rivers and waste is prohibited from being placed on river banks Muddy water generated from construction at construction sites and soil resource sites must be prevented from flowing into surrounding lowlying areas and further affecting the water ecology in the areas Set up pipelines for centralized discharge of rain water collected from roads during the operation area Wastewater discharge must comply with regulations of the Environmental Protection Administration,19
Periodically monitor the water quality and ecology of surrounding water environments during the construction period in order to lower the impact of local water quality on water ecology,20
The ecological environment in surrounding areas of Nanyas operating activities mainly includes plant ecology and animal ecology With regards to plant ecology most of the industrial park where the Company is located has already been developed Nearby areas with less disturbance have maintained a relatively natural secondary forest and a survey did not find any rare plants in nearby areas As for animal ecology a survey found a total of 36 families and 74 species in the industrial park where the Company is located It also found 4 rare and valuable species and 1 conservationdeserving wildlife species After monitoring by an ecology company the Companys operating activities and new factory development have extremely limited effect on plants and plant ecology which is expected to rapidly recover from any impact Hence the Companys current operating activities meet requirements on NNL and zero deforestation In the future we will continue to monitor the ecological environment and fulfill our commitment to ecological resource protection,23
It is necessary to work together with external partners to have a positive impact on ecological resource protection Hence the Company is actively working with ecological monitoring companies and NGOs to better understand the impact of Nanyas operations on ecological resources and formulate more effective methods to manage and mitigate the risk of biodiversity and deforestation,23
Nanya began working with the professional ecological company Hong Yi Ecological Company in 2008 and it helps the Company conduct surveys on ecological resources such as animal and plant ecology in water and on land Ecological monitoring is conducted on a monthly basis during the factory development period and conducted on a quarterly basis during the operation period the ecological company recommends response measures for abnormal situations We make improvements based on the recommendations of the ecological company in order to lower our impact on biodiversity,23
Nanya and CommonWealth Magazine jointly supported the Tamsui River Convention in 2020 and also worked with the NGO The Society of Wilderness in coorganizing ecological environment conservation activities such as removing Mikania micrantha from Wugu Wetland organizing parentchild camps understanding the rich ecology in areas surrounding the factory and admiring swallow and understanding the biodiversity of Wugu Wetland The activities allow participants to understand the relationship between the Company and biodiversity in surrounding areas and improve employees understanding and awareness of the ecological environment,23
Based on the environmental protection and commitments of environmental impact assessment the company regularly monitors environmental impact factors such as air quality noise and vibration the quality of surface water and groundwater traffic flow and the ecosystem within the scope of development to truly appreciate its impacts on the environment There has been no violation of environmental regulations since 2014 In addition Nanya has checked with the competent authorities that Nanyas developing areas are not at an environmentally sensitive location or a location with specific purposes In the Environment Safety and Hygiene Policy Nanya has made every effort to promote various measures to reduce waste and recycle resources to comply with relevant requirements of regulations as well as to respond to the commitments to environmental protectionrelated requirements signed by the company Moreover Nanya annually evaluates waste that can be reduced and recycled and the types and amount of recovered waste water drafts annual plans and goals and includes the plans into the annual budget and work plan,19
Since the plant was set up we have put great emphasis on pollution control Not only have we effectively reduced material consumption and lowered the concentration of waste gas emission but also have used air pollution control equipment in compliance with statutory standards including local scrubber acidalkaline scrubbers the VOCs zeolite rotor concentration equipment and postcombustion machinery Testing proved that the pollutant emission standards set forth in environmental protection regulations of the government were all met lower than over the years To continue to maintain the best performance of treatment equipment every equipment is maintained and inspected periodically The operators receive complete training and education are to maintain the system in good operation and ensure that the waste gases emitted do not endanger the environment,19
Main air pollutants generated by Nanya are divided into acidicalkaline waste gases and organic waste gases Waste gases are channeled to suitable treatment processes and equipment based on their characteristics Waste gases are channeled into local scrubbers after being generated on the process end After removing specific substances acidic or alkaline waste gases are concentrated in acidalkaline scrubbers and released into the atmosphere after treatment Organic waste gas is absorbed and concentrated by the zeolite rotor and then imported into the postcombustion equipment to be directly broken down The combustion efficiency rate reaches 99 which substantially exceeds statutory standards Moreover the reduction rate of overall volatile organic gas emissions is kept above 90 meeting the statutory requirements Organic air pollutants released per unit production capacity emission intensity was 027 kg VOCsm2 in 2021,19
VOCs emissions metric ton VOCs emissions per unit production capacity gthousand die,21

In addition the emergency response to personnel safety such as fire alarm gas leakage leakage odor earthquake and radiation leakage emergency response measures notification procedures and command systems are all in accordance with relevant environmental health and safety regulations Nanya organizes at least one emergency evacuation drill and two fire safety drills each year to ensure the effectiveness of emergency response measures We use quarterly meetings to discuss related prevention and improvement measures on a regular basis to enhance our standard operating procedures We also conduct regular drills for emergency response measures to effectively minimize risks,5
Nanya annually identifies risk items proposed by the Risk Management Steering Center We took response measures against identified risk items based on risk levels A total of 180 risk items were proposed in 2021 and the risk profile and the distribution of risk items and quantities were specified below after identification Based on the statistics 0 items needed immediate improvement 9 items required improvement plans 104 items should have indicators set up for monitoring and 67 items were kept under observation,18
Evaluation criteria of consequence 1 mild 5 severe,9
Evaluation criteria of likelihood 1 rare 5 always,18
After the risk identification items that required improvement plans were mainly on the aspects of operations accounting for 7 items and information security accounting for 2 items Each team had formulated response measures against these items and the measures were implementing Moreover related handling mechanisms were established,1
Electricity Important equipment comply with SEMIF47 Semiconductor Equipment Materials International for the response ability of power system to voltage sag in order to ensure continued operation when there is a sudden drop in voltage within the controllable range DUPS dynamic uninterruptible power supply and diesel emergency power generation system may be installed for important equipment and systems so that it can continue operations using oil in the underground storage tank and supply from Formosa Petrochemical Corporation Simulated different power rationing scenarios for emergency response drills each year Manpower Strengthened elite talent training improved salaries and benefits and maintained the employees royalty to the Company Collaborated with highquality universities and colleges on internships to prevent unstable manpower condition and cooperated with manpower agencies for a long time to recruit shortterm manpower immediately COVID19 Established a pandemic management center formulated pandemic prevention and management plans set up reporting mechanisms and environmental disinfection operating procedures and monitored realtime pandemic risks of each plant area through seat management electronic supplier health declaration forms pandemic prevention promotion and regular audits We established an Pandemic Response Task Force which monitor domestic and foreign pandemic situations at all times and promoted various pandemic prevention and response measures so as to ensure normal operations of the Company,5
Under the continued operation of EHS management systems ISO45001 ISO14001 the Safety and Health Committee is convened by the manager of operations each month and the Safety and Hygiene Division continues to identify potential EHS risks We have established indicators and continue to monitor low risk hazards For medium and high risks we proposed and implemented improvement plans and presented the risks that were identified and their control measures in quarterly risk management meetings In 2021 we found vulnerabilities in the pipelines of our natural gas supply system when reviewing medium risks specifically the risk of natural gas supply being interrupted if an accidental collision causes leakage and the gas cannot be bypassed during repair In response we immediately reviewed the design to strengthen current pipelines and increase backup pipelines for natural gas supply to effectively control this risk For medium high risks in response to the construction of the parking tower in preparation for future factory expansion Nanya sent personnel to step up daily inspections and audits of the construction site and conduct monthly reviews of deficiencies in order to lower the risk of severe occupational accidents from occurring in the process We have consistently directed our efforts to the implementation of Enterprise Risk Management ERM and we continue to identify potential risks and implement management measures for different levels of risk to mitigate the impact of incidents We continue to improve our BCPBCM to rapidly recover from impacts and reduce losses,9
Computers of relatively high risk endpoints are managed using ACL Access Control List and some important equipment have UTM Unified Threat Management system to lower the scope affected by risks,1
We plan to install an information security monitoring system to monitor the list of assets and network topology implement vulnerability management and risk assessment and use AI for big data analysis to achieve early discovery of potential threats,1
Finance Risk The sales of DRAM products are mainly conducted in US dollars Nanya established an offshore subsidiary at the end of 2018 to reduce the impact of exchange rates on the US dollar positions held by the parent company In the future we will continue to periodically review and manage the US dollar positions and implement the following practices,15
Convert the US dollar cash to the New Taiwan dollar and keep the lowest US dollar positions Evaluate the use of preselling Foreign Exchange Forward to lower the exchange rate risk of accounts receivable Evaluate the increase in debt denominated in US dollars to offset the exchange rate risk of accounts receivable for retention of reasonable US dollar net positions to reduce the impact of appreciation depreciation in New Taiwan dollars on profit and loss,18
Compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act In response to the personal data protection regulations of the European Union United States China and Taiwan Nanya has obtained the consent or authorization of employees and customers and updated labor contracts and employee manuals of overseas subsidiaries to ensure employee and customer privacy With regard to crossborder transmission of information we have signed crossborder agreements that comply with the regulations of each country or the official version agreements and immediately update the versions to ensure their effectiveness,22
Compliance with the climate change regulations We will cooperate with the governments longterm goals and implement carbon emission reduction measures which are also included in the planning and design of new factories The best available control technology BACT is used for air pollution prevention equipment The prohibition or restricted use of GHG with high warming potential are prohibited or restricted and may affect the use of process raw materials We will evaluate a voluntary reduction plan to offset our emissions and pay carbon fees according to the type of emissions which may increase operating costs A late penalty equal to 05 the amount of carbon fees payable will be imposed for each day payment is overdue and a maximum fine of NT1 million may be imposed Nanya has low risk of being ordered to suspend operations,21
Intellectual property protection Due to the industrys characteristics it is inevitable that we will face lawsuits filed by nonpatent entities NPEs Nanya has formulated intellectual property management strategies strengthened its patent portfolio effectively defended against frivolous lawsuit and established a trade secret registration system to systematically manage trade secrets The implementation progress is reported to the Board of Directors each year and is disclosed on the official website,4
Compliance with antitrust regulation During the era of global commercial activities many countries have strengthened antitrust law enforcement The awareness of and compliance with antitrust regulations are highly associated with corporate development and reputation and the management may bear civil liability for noncompliance with such regulations Nanya has collaborated with legal experts of different countries periodically gathered international antitrust standards and enforcement status and comprehensively promoted the compliance with antitrust regulations to the staff Currently we have only one antitrust lawsuit case being appealed in the courts in Brazil and this has no material impacts on our operations,0
Nanya pays close attention to changes in the economic environment We identify longterm risks and opportunities and adapt our business strategies to ensure sustainability and longterm operating performance Each risk management team or managers at each level gathers related domestic and international information to evaluate potential risks in the Companys longterm operations They used questionnaires or evaluations in meetings of senior executives to identify emerging risks with the highest level of potential impact in the future and review mitigation and response strategies The topics and strategies are reported to the Risk Management Steering Center for resolution and used as important references for formulating future business strategies,18
Gather related information on emerging risks from internal and external sources,18

Establish material emerging risk management strategies and plans,18
Compile information on related risks and establish methods to identify emerging risks,18
Predetermine and analyze potential impact of various risk items,18
Performance followup and improvement conducted by each risk management team,18
Department heads gathered emerging risks in 2021 and senior executives identified four material emerging risks Nanya has formulated response countermeasures while continuing to implement improvements with the aim of mitigating related impacts,18
Emerging Risk 1 Information SecurityHackingViruses may cause production operations or financial losses,1
The rise and convenience of the Internet and rise of cryptocurrency provides an excellent environment for cyber criminals to hide The number of information security incidents mainly extortion has significantly increased due to cyberattacks from hackersviruses The number of major information security incidents among public companies in Taiwan in the fourth quarter of 2021 was higher than the total of the first three quarters as shown in the table below,1
According to Nanyas internal statistics the number of hacking attempts has significantly increased since the beginning of 2021 information security risk significantly increased as the number of hacking attempts in 2022Q1 increased 174 compared to the 2021Q4 and increased 702 compared with the first quarter of 2021,1
If hackers use system vulnerabilities or social engineering to obtain classified and sensitive data of the Company or customers they will be able to threaten or extort the Company or customers and cause financial loss or customerbusiness loss Nanya has successfully developed process technology and designed products If hacking causes RD data to be stolen or leaked it will threaten the Companys sustainable development and profitability If hackers damage the Companys system or database it will paralyze the Companys operations or cause production or operational losses,1
Step up network monitoring mechanisms to immediately discover abnormal conduct and lower the probability of hacking or data leakage,1
Strengthen the depth of defense between the physical layer and data layer to increase the difficulty of hacking and encrypt classified documents to protect them from being used or threatened after being leaked,1
Continue to patch system vulnerabilities to lower known risks,1
Continue to analyze emerging hacking methods patch system and network vulnerabilities to block attacks,1
Continue to conduct information security incident drills to improve emergency response abilities for hacking,5
Evaluate the purchase of information security insurance to reduce the losses caused by hackers,1
Emerging Risk 2 China accelerating the development of DRAM technology may hinder Nanyas business development in China,18
Emerging Risks 3 The governments energy transformation and carbon reduction policy may put pressure on Nanyas operations,12
Emerging Risk 4 The war between Russia and Ukraine may prevent Nanya from obtaining sufficient supply of special gases and cause production to be suspended,17
The COVID19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains and increased dependence on technology products The USChina conflict caused each country to expand the scope and scale of technological developments and build selfsufficient supply chains,17
China already decided to develop a selfsufficient semiconductor supply chain before the COVID19 pandemic and USChina trade war Hence as the US and China continue to decouple we expect Chinas government to continue supporting DRAM manufacturers and it will affect our business development in China,17
Nanya does not have any factories in China and we expect Chinese companies to give priority to the products of local DRAM manufacturers to avoid geopolitical risk,15
At present Chinas DRAM products are mainly used in mobiles and consumer electronics products and partially overlap with Nanyas products We expect the products to start affecting our sales in Chinas market in 2023,15
In the future if Chinese DRAM manufacturers make a breakthrough in the development of technologies and products it will increase their output and may hinder our business development in China,15
Continue to observe developments in USChina relations and make timely adjustments to sales strategy in response,3
Monitor the progress of new demand from customers and commence mass production in a timely manner to increase global sales capacity actively expand customers in sales regions around the world and increase the percentage of sales accounted for by European and American markets,4
Continue to research and develop new technologies and products actively expand the market with higher added value and increase the proportion of revenue from the markets to reduce the potential impact of Chinese DRAM manufacturers,15
Taiwans government adopted a new energy policy to achieve a nonnuclear homeland and international carbon reduction commitment by 2025 and is thus promoting the energy transformation of Taiwan Power Company and general enterprises,12
Taiwans government may begin collecting carbon fees in 2023 which might increase Nanyas operating costs,12
The government is expected to set carbon emission limits for each industry in 35 years to control total GHG emissions,25
During peak electricity usage in the future if the power generators or transmission and distribution systems of Taiwan Power Company malfunction and renewable energy supply is unstable it may result in power rationing,24
When Taiwan begins to collect carbon fees in the future Nanya expects expenses to increase NT47150 million each year in 20232025 Starting in 2026 carbon fees will gradually increase as the new factory is completed and machinery is installed which will impact profits,12
Additional expenses are required to purchase carbon rights when GHG emissions exceed the total limit,25
Nanya uses neon krypton and argon gas mixture in its processes and indirectly uses neon The supply of neon has been impacted by the war between Russia and Ukraine,25
Two Ukrainian companies Ingas located in Mariupol and Cryoin located in Odessa supply approximately 4554 of the worlds neon According to a report by Reuters in March 2022 Ingas and Cryoin have been forced to suspend operations The damage to their neon production lines remains unclear,17
The price of neon krypton and argon gas mixture to be used in 2022 Q4 was significantly higher compared with the same period last year before the war causing procurement cost to significantly increase,24
There is significant uncertainty in the neon krypton and argon gas mixture that Nanya will need to purchase in 2023 If neon production lines are severely damaged even if the war between Russia and Ukraine ends it will take time for Ingas and Cryoin to return to normal supply It will also take time for companies in other regions to increase production so there might continue to be a shortage of neon supply starting in 2023 Failing to stock up might cause production to be suspended,17
To respond to and prevent the risk of power rationing we have installed diesel fuel power generators and Dynamic Uninterruptible Power Supply DUPS to increase the operational resilience of our factories and planned the following measures,3
Set electricity saving plans and reduce overall electricity consumption,24
Reduce electricity use for nonproduction purposes when there is insufficient power supply,24
Review available space and install solar panels to generate electricity for self use,24
In response to future limits on GHG emissions Nanya began implementing the SBT project in 2022 to reduce GHG emissions please refer to the Feature Stories Towards a Future with Net Zero Emissions for details,25
Nanya has a safety stock of neon krypton and argon gas mixture until the end of 2022 and also required suppliers to increase their stock,14
We are negotiating longterm contracts with current suppliers to ensure sufficient supply for 2023,17
We will continue to use diverse supply sources and monitor subsequent developments to lower our risk,17
To establish comprehensive risk management culture Nanya established the Risk Management Committee under the Board of Directors to supervise the Companys implementation of various risk management systems along with the effective operation of the systems mechanisms so as to reach the goals of risk management In accordance with the defined scopes organizations duties and risk management procedures stipulated in the Risk Management Regulations the committee has fully implemented risk management tasks and held meetings twice in 2021 to review the implementation and operation of risk management,18
The Risk Management Steering Center consists of three directors and managers the President the Executive Vice President and Vice President Wu who serve as the centers Director and Deputy Director to instill risk awareness in the management and enhance risk management Moreover the center annually reviews the performance of risk management implementation and emerging risks facing in the future Nanya shall also include the results of risk management into annual performance evaluation items for the management President and supervisors ranked Assistant Vice President and above They shall execute operations based on the approval of the Board of Directors and use target management for senior managers to expand risk management measures and fully enhance the Companys risk awareness,18
Nanya provides a variety of incentives to encourage employee proposals and stimulate peers to think innovatively and reduce potential risks The proposals are reviewed based on the expected benefits creativity application scope completeness and quality contributions and incentives are provided as encouragement accordingly Nanya set up a 24hour instant case report system information security line employee feedback mechanisms etc to provide employees with immediate response We have deeprooted the risk management culture among all employees through TV walls posters and computer wallpapers,0
Our performance evaluation regulations have incorporated the risk management awareness and implementation status of employees into evaluation items of quarterly performance evaluation and yearend performance evaluation to serve as the basis for performance rating promotion bonuses issuance of stock option while having risk management measures been implemented Furthermore Nanya also irregularly organizes management activities to raise employees risk awareness such as the Information Security Month in 2021 during which information security seminars online QA information security challenge and information security angel selection built employees consensus of information security and created a culture in which all employees participate in the prevention and improvement of risks,1
Number of improvement proposals put forward by employees and benefits,11
Nanya annually arranges for the directors in the management to attend corporate governance and risk management courses held by institutions approved by the government Moreover Nanya also arranged for Risk Management Committee members to attend risk management courses on the aspect of business strategies in 2021 so as to assist and strengthen the Companys risk management operations In addition we also compiles risk management education materials and requires employees to read on the computer system each year in order to improve risk awareness of all employees The completion of employee risk management education and training achieve the goal of 100 coverage rate in 2021 with a total of 1724 training hours We hope that through the education and training the staff could fully understand the Companys risk management operation status and implement the risk management awareness in daily management,18
management education and training achieve the goal of 100 coverage rate in 2021 with a total of 1724 training hours,2
