eMemorys business model is different from the typical business model of our peers It is based on,3
a triangular relationship between design houses the foundries and ourselves,4
When eMemory licenses its technology to a foundry the foundry partner then pays a license fee for,12
the technical setup and license grant For design houses either a usage fee or NRE fee is collected,12
when a complete design is licensed Technology license fees usage fees and NRE fees are all,12
categorized as upfront fees by eMemory Later when a product is tapedout or massproduced,15
eMemory receives running royalties from our foundry partners based on the contractually agreed,12
This business model creates a much closer and sustainable collaboration among all three parties and,3
allows eMemory to take an active role in supporting product development to completion On the,15
foundry side we are a memory technology provider with the design houses we license our macro,1
block design and for both we offer technical support With our technologies and macro designs,15
our partners can further design energyefficient and costefficient chips to be utilized across a broad range of markets,15
In May of 2021 Taiwan raised the COVID19 alert to Level 3 to control the pandemic outbreak,13
Policies such as prohibiting unnecessary gatherings remaining within social distance wearing masks,9
and shutting down all venues for entertainment were strictly executed eMemory has also,12
implemented comprehensive epidemic prevention practices to protect the health of our employees,5
and their family and to maintain daily operations,3
Starting from midMay 2021 all employees were required to work from home except for essential,11
workers Anyone who needed to come to the office was instructed to wear masks and gloves,9
properly and to leave the office immediately once the tasks were finished To prevent any cross,0
infection we arranged weekly disinfection of the office and the labs,19
For remote working practices essential equipment communication tools virtual design platform,15
and virtual private networks were provided and frequently updated to sustain daily operations and,1
ensure information security Moreover an internal reporting system was built for the employees to,1
report any concerns about their health conditions We also provided our employees with pandemic,9
Not only did we put the health of our employees at top priority but we also wanted to help society,9
and fight the pandemic together eMemory donated 1 million NT dollars to the National Taiwan,5
University Hospital HsinChu Branch to support antiepidemic related research and health,5
promotion programs We will continue taking cautious approaches to pandemic prevention and,13
protecting the health of our employees their family and society,10
eMemory conducts the materiality survey each year to identify the major material issues that our,12
stakeholders value the most We continued to use the same 18 material issues established last year,12
The issues are selected based on information from peers in the industry and international,12
A questionnaire containing the 18 issues was distributed to our stakeholders including employees,10
investors customers suppliers and government agencies Stakeholders were asked to rank the,17
issues from the most important to the least important by category There were 76 questionnaires,2
distributed and 68 effective responses received which equated to an 895 response rate,5
For business impact analysis there were 44 managers departmentleveled managers and above,8
taking part in the survey The managers rated the issues in terms of the likelihood of potential,18
interruptions to business operations These inputs from our managers reflected material issues that,18
are critical to our daily operations and future corporate development,3
n r e c n o C r e d o h e k a t S,12
Integrating and standardizing the data received we finalized the materiality matrix and identified 11,12
prioritized material issues that appear to be the most important to eMemory and our stakeholders,12
These prioritized material issues were the same as the ones chosen last year with seven in the,12
governance aspect and four in the social aspect,10
Following these material issues that are crucial to us and our stakeholders eMemory adopts the,12
sustainability approaches to daily operations Carefully managing and preventing the potential risks,3
related to these material issues we hope to bring satisfaction to our stakeholders as well as increase,10
our positive impacts on sustainability for our value chain and the society,3

that all personnel and operations at eMemory comply with relevant laws and regulations,12
eMemory engages with stakeholders through a variety of communication channels that touch on important issues,10
and investors help us go further on the,12
our IPs can be evaluated and pass various,1
Environmental protection is one of the most important parts of corporate sustainability While,23
eMemory authorizes pollutionfree silicon IPs and does not manufacture tangible products we are,19
committed to protecting the environment by adopting sustainable practices in our daily operations,23
Given the business characteristics of eMemory the verification of the Environmental Management,3
System EMS does not apply to eMemory Nonetheless eMemory complies with all environmental,12
regulations on environmental protection energy conservation and water resource protection,23
We adhere to the sustainable environmental protection management policies and promote,23
practices of reducing reusing and recycling in the office Our daily work environments use energy,15
efficient lighting heating and cooling systems We are also transforming to paperless operations to,24
conserve paper usage and increase work efficiency Regular inspections of GHG emissions water,25
consumption and total waste generation are performed All of these measures help to ensure our,19
Most of the companys energy consumption is from airconditioning and lighting To reduce energy consumption and decrease operation costs the lighting within the company uses high efficient,24
energysaving lightemitting diode LED The airconditioners are also inspected and cleaned,21
periodically to maintain efficiency and timers are configured on the airconditioners after certain,24
nonworking hours The total electricity consumption in 2021 was 1374725 kWh with 46287 kWh,24
per capita a decrease of 21 compared to 47291 kWh per capita in 2020,24
Since eMemory does not operate factories of any sort we do not have direct GHG emissions Scope,25
1 The main source of GHG emissions is indirect GHG emissions Scope 2 which are associated with,25
the purchase of electricity from Taiwan Power Company In 2021 the total carbon dioxide emission,21
was 690112kg with 23394 kg of average emission per capita which is a reduction of 28 from,21
2407 kg in 2020 The emission of carbon dioxide is expected to reach 2300 kg per capita by 2022,25
which we have almost achieved and will work toward it,12
We use water in our daily operations for food services and sanitation The main water sources are,20
the Touqian River and Baoshan Reservoir The total water consumption in 2021 was 3372 kL with,20
114 kL average water consumption for each person a drop of 143 compared to 133 kL in 2020 Our future goal is to maintain the water consumption by 12 kL per capita The Taiyuen HiTech,20
Industrial Park Science Park where eMemory is located has a sewage recovery system This will,20
be used for the watering of plants and flowers around the Science Park The domestic sewage is,23
discharged to the domestic sewage treatment facilities in the Science Park before being discharged,20
to the water system without significant impact on the water system,20
Although no manufacturing wastes are produced we implement careful waste management of,19
waste collection recycling and disposal The waste is collected by employees in the temporary waste storage area The cleaning service company that we have a contract with assists in its recycling,19
and removal The waste is then transported by a qualified waste handling operator for treatment,19
and final disposal The total weight of domestic waste in 2021 was 3525kg equaling 119 kg per,19
capita 93 kg for general waste and 26kg for recycled resources,19
Water Consumption and Waste Produced from 2019 2021,19
eMemory supports energy conservation and environmental protection by continuing to develop,23
advanced semiconductor process technologies that support our customers designs Collaboratively,15
our customers can thereby produce the most advanced energyefficient and environmental,15
friendly products possible With advances in the semiconductor manufacturing process and the,15
increasing complexity of IC design our IPs can be used to enhance the efficiency of the IC design,15
process and shorten development time As the process nodes evolve not only is the chip size,3
significantly reduced but the power consumption of each type of chip is effectively reduced,24
Take display driver ICs DDI for example which is one of the applications with the largest shipments,24
among various products embedded with our IPs The main demand for DDI covers from 035m High,15
Voltage Process HV to 28nm HV Each generation of the HV process saves 5070 of power,24
consumption compared to the previous generation As the process advances the power saving rate,24
is reduced to 3050 Based on these power consumption characteristics it is conservatively,24
estimated that the average power saving rate of DDI chips embedded with eMemorys IP was 136,24
Based on the wafer shipments of major products in 2021 we helped to reduce the electricity,15
consumption of the enduse products with our IPs up to 390 million kWh which is equivalent to,15
195000 tons of CO2 emissions equivalent to the carbon absorption capacity of 430 New York Central Park,25
Moreover eMemorys IP can improve the stability and yield of the wafers and further reduce,4
resource consumption during wafer manufacturing During the fabrication and packaging stages the,17
trimming function of eMemorys IP can be used to meet the required product specifications thereby,15
reducing the cost of wafer remanufacturing Based on the wafer shipment in 2021 eMemory,24
contributed to saving nearly NT160 billion in manufacturing costs and reduced 253 billion kilowatt,24
hours of electricity usage and 12 million cubic meters of water consumption equivalent to the,20
carbon adsorption of nearly 2800 New York Central Park and the water consumption of 4867,20
In addition our PUFbased solutions can help to reduce and recycle electronic waste ewaste,19
throughout the product lifecycle Nowadays with various electronic devices being manufactured e,15
waste has become another vital environmental issue Discarded ewaste could cause public health,19
and environmental concerns and security breaches without proper disposal Our PUFbased IPs,1
provide each chipdevice with its own unique identity and root of trust which strengthens product,3
and application security It prolongs the product lifecycle and prevents the chipdevice from,15
becoming ewaste due to a lack of security protection During the decommissioning phase we can,1
also easily track the discarded products by their unique IDs to properly recycle and decommission,15
the products which further prevents the ecosystem from being hacked,1
eMemory values intellectual property rights patent quality and patent protection We continue to,4
enhance both the quantity and quality of our IPs to create economic value and strengthen,4
competitive advantages Our Patent Strategy Committee formulates patent strategies and annual,4
goals based on eMemorys business objectives The patent process control patent risk reminding,4
and other IP rights related matters are performed and inspected by the Intellectual Property,4
Department Each patent is carefully reviewed by the Patent Examination Board before application,4
to guarantee the novelty and quality of the patent,4
The patent portfolio developed by eMemory has spread all over Taiwan United States China Japan,4
