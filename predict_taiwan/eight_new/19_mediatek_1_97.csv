4day teacher empowerment training enables teachers to make their own technology courses The program is not bound to specific hardware Teachers can freely select micro bit Arduino LinkIt 7697 or ESP32 based mechatronic and IoT technologies in line with the schools conditions and status Participants are familiarized with PBL problembased learning teaching skills for technology application courses In the final part of the training participating teachers get an opportunity to refine their course planning techniques through a oneonone consultation with the instructor,2
At midsemester program participants are invited to engage in exchanges of experiences in course organization This activity provides an opportunity for the sharing of benchmark cases and frustrating experiences and mutual support The ultimate goal is to bring new momentum to ensure the ongoing organization of such practiceoriented courses,2
In 2021 a total of 29 elementary and middle schools received assistance in the organization of official,2
technology courses or clubs A total of 45 official courses and 14 clubs are currently available for 496 middle,2
school students Mediatek Foundation visited part of these schools to gain a clear understanding of actual,12
conditions at each school and the challenges facing firstline instructors,2

This has been the most rewarding year in my 24year teaching,2
career This Course Maker has been long overdueThe teaching,8
approaches I learned from the instructors paired with the,8
equipment we purchased with the aid of MediaTek subsidies have,12
empowered and emboldened me The feedback from my students,8

The aim is to cultivate the next generation with handson problemsolving ability popularize scientific,2
exploration and practices on our campuses and focus on the injection of resources into remote areas and regions,23
Support is provided in five stages including encompasses,2

teachers and 191 students were recognized for their,2
achievements in the context of this Practical Science,12
guidance A total of 67 teachers participated in this,2
has motivated me to keep refining my teaching approaches instead of clinging to traditional non,2
innovative textbookbased approaches This year I use teaching materials that I created myself and,2
lesson plans that I have composed I complete all exercises and practices myself before I assign them,9
to my studentsThese brandnew challenges helped me grow a lot as an educator,2
Course maker is quite tiring but seeing my students faces light,8
up makes it all worthwhile Through participat in this program we,12
not only gained funding but also received guidance in the gradual,12
adoption of PBL approaches by firstline IT instructors which has,12
been really helpful Foundation offer us opportunities for ongoing,12
studies and provide needed funds for participati in competitions They empathize with our needs,12
Note Mr Lin have garnered two silver one bronze and one honorable mention award at the Pacific Cup,8
Donation of popular science books and book report card activity,12
A total of 1750 copies of 50 carefully selected popular science books published last year were donated to 35,12
selected schools in 2021 These books represent precious reading resources for schools that lack such resources,2
A significant number of schools have set up designated popular science reading areas or book carts,2
The book donation was followed by a book report card,12
activity A total of 1365 such cards were received 1201,12
books were shared with friends and relatives by students,2
who recorded their gained insights with the aid of,4
pictures and text In addition an online exhibition of the,2
submitted cards has been organized to share the insights,12
of these children with the public This activity reached,2
This marks the tenth year of our intertidal zone themed science,23
project Our experiments have been subsidized by MediaTek for,12
four consecutive years In the biological research process our,2
students have conducted intensive studies of urchins for almost,23
two years which in hindsight is quite extraordinary,12
Technology changes rapidly and children change their preferences more and more frequently The only,22
way to make children focus on the same topic for an extended period is a science project Repeated,2
corroboration of ideas and speculations exposes children to scientific exploration processes They learn,4
how to focus and commit to a certain research object and thereby build up their confidence When I see,3
the confidence and focus in their eyes during the final stage I am absolutely certain that what matters,12
most is not success but rather the transformation of the children,2
This joy and happiness is my greatest motivation for forging ahead,9
Gongliao Elementary School in New Taipei City the school,2
garnered an Honorable Mention Award in its first city,12

schools the students had to introduce their work to the judges on the day of the final reviews,12
which was an invaluable experience for the children Our original intention was simply to give the,2
students a chance to carry out experiments in a meticulous manner We never thought we could pass,2
the preliminary and final reviews or even win an award We are overjoyed to be presented with this,12
Honorable Mention Award This represents a great source of motivation for us and we are deeply,12
grateful to MediaTek Foundation for their support and sponsorship We will continue to embrace a,12
