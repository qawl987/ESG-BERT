Macronix has completed the adoption of alternative materials and the improvement of the manufacturing processes regarding hazardous substances used in electronics that are of concern to the international community and specied in the EU RoHS Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive We received the IECQ QC 080000 Hazardous Substances Process Management System Certification in November 2007 which confirmed that our products comply with RoHS and customer requirements Thanks to our thorough hazardous substance management system we have been awarded green product certications from many internationally renowned customers,19
Our main consideration regarding waste management strategies is to recycle and reuse Our waste production is categorized into general waste and hazardous waste both of which are entrusted to qualified wastetreatment companies for subsequent waste treatment Before entrusting the waste for the treatment it is necessary to conrm whether the treatment method adopted by the entrusted company is appropriate and the company must pass the relevant review procedures before being entrusted with the waste treatment In view of the increasing emphasis of current government agencies on waste disposal Macronix will continue to supervise and manage wastetreatment companies and conduct their onsite audits In 2021 Macronix initiated a total of 44 audits at selected new waste,19
treatment companies and already available ones During the audits not only the licenses of the companies were conrmed but also their product and sales ow were recorded as the basis for evaluation Furthermore no incidents of severe leakage related to the waste disposal were reported in 2021,19
The total waste disposal output in 2021 was approximately 11428 tons of which the majority of 627 was hazardous waste Recyclingreuse rates reached 94 general waste and 99 hazardous waste and the total recyclingreuse rate reached 972 Landfill treatment which has a heavy burden on the environment was 29 metric tons of waste and the landfill rate was only 02 which shows that the Company takes environmentally friendly methods of waste disposal as a priority In the disposal process there was no waste was exported overseas,19
To effectively control waste generated by the Company and the recycling rate Macronix has set up annual targets and reviews them every quarter to ensure that the operations comply with the given targets The Company reduces waste by cutting down the consumption of materials through the joint efforts of engineering departments based on a feasible reduction plan,19

Electricity usage Scope 2 is one of Macronixs largest sources of carbon emissions In view of this Macronix conducts inplant inspections every year to actively look for energyconservation solutions Macronix proposed an updated energyconservation improvement plan for Compress Dry Air CDA equipment in 2021 thus greatly reducing the energy consumption of back end operations at fabs The energy consumption of the original CDA compressor per m3 of air pressure ow is 82 kilowatts kW and the air volume processed per minute is 11 m3 The energy consumption of the new highefficiency CDA compressor per m3 of air pressure flow is 65 kilowatts kW and the air volume processed per minute increased to 245 m3,21
This replacement saves about 367920 kWh of electricity each year and reduces carbon emissions by about 185 tons of CO2 emissions thereby contributing to the mitigation of climate change,25
It is wonderful to have the opportunity to participate in the Companys installation of a new air compressor for the smooth power transmission,21
Listening to the fascinating sound of the air compressor as it runs and watching its excellent energy efficiency I am honored to be able to contribute to the sustainability of the earth,24
Risks that may result from failure to effectively manage greenhouse gas hereinafter referred to as GHG emissions include stricter regulations increasing carbon fee and climaterelated physical risks eg water shortage and plant and equipment damages caused by typhoons,25

In response to the trend of GHG reductions control and reduction in the supply chain due to global warming Macronix began planning for GHG emissions inventory control and reduction in 2000 and obtained the 2005 ISO140641 GHG emissions verication statement in 2007,25
We established the units to manage GHG according to ISO 140641 verification standards as illustrated below Through the complete management system we performed thorough checks on the energy use conditions in our facilities and ofces and thereby established inventory records and internal procedures for GHG inventories Therefore we are able to use the information as a basis for selecting alternative production technologies with reduced energy consumption and GHG emissions in order to achieve our goal in this respect Ozonedepleting substances ODS controlled by the Montreal Protocol are identied during the GHG inventory but are not included in emissions according to regulations of the EPA,25
In response to global climate change and carbon reduction trends and in the hope of contributing to the mitigation of global warming beside directing our efforts to energy conservation and carbon reduction in manufacturing processes and equipment we are also actively participating in governmentguided projects,13
In 2018 we participated in the Industrial Development Bureaus Low Carbon Technology Industrial Application Subsidy Project and completed the Fab 5s project plan for the newly installed point of use POU abatement equipments for the manufacturing machines We applied to the Environmental Protection Administration for the registration of our GHG offset project in 2019 to gain an offset quota The project passed review of the Environmental Protection Administration at the end of 2020 and the monitoring plan for the expected 50 of the machines was completed in 2021 It is expected that the remaining machine testing monitoring reports and verication of reduction will be completed in 2022 It is estimated that there will be a reduction of more than 10000 tons each year,25
All of the Companys plants completed ISO 146041 Scope 1 2 and 3 inventory and thirdparty verification in 2021 The data covers all plants and sites excluding subsidiaries According to regulations of the EPA the GWP value of the GHG inventory was changed in 2016 to the Fourth Assessment Report released in 2007 by IPCC As a result the Company adjusted the base year to 2011 and has made relevant changes to the table and chart of GHG emissions in this report In accordance with the operation control method Macronix calculated the 7 kinds of GHGs including CO2 CH4 N2O,25
