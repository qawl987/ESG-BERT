We  introduced  green  design  IEC  62430  in  2010  and  continued  to  promote  the thinking of product life cycle asking to implement green elements at the source of design to lower the environmental impacts and risks of the products at each phase of product life cycle for products and components we design while achieving a simple design In 2013 we incorporated ecological design in quality management producing products that can both help the environment and have good functions We thereby ,"15

"
In 2013 we started obtaining integrative design ISO 14006 and green design IEC 62430 declarative statements for products such as display projector smart phone scanner multimedia player and lamp,"15
"
I Ecological Design GuidelineDirectionQisda requires that we should implement greendesign thinking at the initial phase of product  RD  to  lower  the  environmental  impacts  and  risks  of  the  products  at  each phase of product life cycle for products and components we design and perform a fair management  at  the  source  of  design  Therefore  we  set  up  a  crossBU  green  design guideline according to the design experience and current status of each production line offering  RD  staff  the  direction  of  green  design  and  related  manufacturing  procedureprocess choice,"15
"
For the design RD stage we focus on our four green design directions Reduce Volume Manage Hazardous Substance Preserve Energy and Recycle Related actions and results are as follows,"19
"
The goals and results of 20162020 are compared with that in 2015 If comparing the 2015 results with that in 2009 we preserved energy by 4542 reduced volume by 2296 reduced carbon by 3203 in 2015,"24
"
Volume reduction aspect covers reducing volume weight or products and packages as well as number of components of products,"15
"
Since we are a professional OEM we manufacture electronic prodcuts for brands or other customers the calculation of prouct carbon footprints do not include usage and discard phases,"24
"
For hazardous substance management please refer to the Quality and NoHazardous Substance Management Chapter,"19
"
2020 TargetsEnergy Saving 5Material Reduction 5Carbon Reduction 5,"24
"
We mainly consider reducing the volume and weight of products and packages as well as the  number  of  components  of  products  while  designing  with  modules  In  2020  the average weight reduction of each product line was 2642,"15
"
For products that might use chemical substances during production process that might affect the  environmental  safety  we  compile  the  Hazardous  Chemical  Substance  Control  List according to the requirements of international regulations and customers With strict control in  recognizing  component  materials  and  inspection  on  nished  products  we  ensure  our products meet the requirements of international regulations and customers by a systematic management mechanism We expect to reduce usage of hazardous chemical substances each year while avoiding harms done to human bodies and the environment by products when delivered used and discarded,"14
"
We focus on the improvement of energy efficiency30 and lowering of energy consumption during standby mode while comparing the data of models of the current generation with that of the previous one to verify whether energy preservation performance is reached Besides meeting  international  requirements  such  as  ErP  TCO  Total  Cost  of  Ownership  and Energy  Star  Qisda  upholds  the  purpose  consideration  and  model  of  self  and  constant improvements In 2020 the average energy preservation was 2506,"24
"
We consider the produce recycling rate and disassembling difficulty at the design phase We should consider the product joining method at the beginning of design avoiding materials and manufacturing procedure process not easy to disassemble such as glue weld or embed For products  and  samples  with  plastic  components  larger  than  25g  there  should  be  a  label marking  materials  used  while  adopted  plastic  components  should  not  mix  more  than  two kinds of materials,"15
"
To realize ecological design for all models and meet the requirements of customerscountries of sales while continuing to promote volume reduction energy preservation and carbon reduction the design ow of models can be divided into the following three phases,"24
"
At the middlephase of design we use the internal WEEE Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment  Directive  200296EC  platform  to  assess  the  product  recycling  rate  and assess whether the rate reaches the required base line before entering the next design phase,"19
"
In  addition  to  meeting  the  demands  from  customers  and  countries  of  sales  Qisda proactively assess whether our products can have more simplied designs to cut down unnecessary manufacturing procedures and components Annual audits are administered to assess the environmental impacts of individual product category including the design ,"15

"
Design check Verify again the difference between the design layout and prototype and its s well as identify quality issues if any,"15
"
Ecological  design  level  assessment  Understand  whether  we  meet  the demands  from  other  international  requirements  on  the  basis  that  we meet requirements of customers and countries of sales The ecological design status of a product will be ranked gold silver and bronze while an analysis  on  its  design  strength  and  weakness  will  be  provided  for nextgeneration products as references,"15

Qisdas  manufacturing  procedures  dont  require  water consumption but we need to provide clean drinking water for employees  We  use  the  WRI  World  Resources  Institute Aqueducts  global  water  risk  mapping  tool  to  analyze  results Taiwan  and  Suzhou  China  factories  are  located  in  areas  of midlevel water shortage risks However water consumption of all factories only comes from municipal water supply For the past 15 years only one incident of water supply shortage occurred We  already  set  up  an  emergency  response  ow  for  water shortage  If we receive notication from the government or if there  is  media  report  about  recent  water  source  becoming muddy  due  to  typhoons  or  if  there  is  drought  and  causes temporary water supply suspension or rationing we will notify contract  water  wheels  to  supplement  the  insufficient  amount  of water to avoid production line halts due to water shortage,"20
"
All  factory  water  consumption  comes  from  municipal  water supply  no  underground  water  is  abstracted  for  operations  we adopt ltering equipment for drinking water and inspect regularly according to regulations to ensure the water quality is safe,"20
"
The  water  pollution  prevention  equipment  at  the  Taiwan plant is operated and maintained by professional staff We use the biolm treatment system to deal with domestic sewage whereas the water generated is discharged into the management system of the sewage sewer of the government The sewage of the  Suzhou  plant  is  directly  discharged  into  the  municipal sewer  system  with  the  nal  destination  being  the  sewer management  system  Therefore  there  will  be  no  direct inuence on the water body and land due to sewage created by  water  consumption  Also  the  effluent  water  quality  is monitored regularly and inspected according to regulations The results  are  better  than  the  regulated  standards  For  the previous  years  there  were  no  water  pollution  incidents  at each factory,"20
"
According  to  the  WRI  Aqueduc ts  global  water  risk mapping tool analysis Taiwan and Suzhou factories are not in areas with high ood risks In the past 15 years there were no losses  due  to  oods  at  factories  Also  we  set  up  controlling ows  such  as  prevention  and  emergency  response  Before typhoons we will ask cleaning staff to specically clean ditches to facilitate drainage avoiding factory oods due to impeded drainage We also prepare in advance emergency equipment such as sandbag and ood control gate for emergency ,"5
"
At  the  end  of  each  quarter  we  regularly  inspect  the  compliance state of waterrelated regulations If there are any updates of regulations we immediately respond to them Recently there were no related illegal incidents about water at factories,"20
"
No  matter  in  Suzhou  China  or  Taiwan  water  expenses  are low  Taiwan  has  not  started  collecting  water  consumption expenses  Since  our  factories  do  not  consume  much  water the inuence on costs in the future will be very low,"20
