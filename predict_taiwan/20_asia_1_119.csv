Asia Cements Total Shore Power Supply building green low carbon harbors,"24
"
In  facing  the  wave  of  global  green  supply  Asia  Cement  relentlessly  develops the technology of low carbon manufacturing process in the hope of contributing to environmental sustainability  In terms of the the selling and transporting of cement in addition to mining and production energy saving and carbon reduction are equally important  ,"24
"
For  the  business  of  transporting  cement  from  eastern  to  western  Taiwan that is the selling of the cement produced in Hualien Plant to various places in Taiwan and foreign markets Asia Cement started to build the dedicated cement ships in the 80s Currently there are four ships belonging to UMing Marine a company in the group ,"19
"
In the past the cement ships were using fuel to generate power for various power needs on board As a result they generated noise and air pollution  For  the  purpose  of  reducing  the  impacts  to  ocean  ecological  system  and environment in two phases Asia Cement worked with UMing Marine and completed the shore power supply engineering at the piers of four warehousing and shipping stations in Kaohsiung Taichung Keelung and Hualien harbors plus four cement ships the total investment was up to NT37390000,"21
"
Asia Cement completed the total shore power supply engineering for all cement ships in 2021 while the cement ship is docking at the pier it will not use the onboard generator to supply power any more rather totally switching over to the onshore power source of Taipower Company  The use of oil by ships was reduced down to zero  It can not only save ship use of oil over 1474 ton but also effectively reduce 5329 tons of CO2 emission and NOx and SOx  emission    Furthermore  the  unloading  efficiency  of  the  cement  ships is largely increased the unloading time is shortened by 50 a pioneering achievement in the cement industry of Taiwan  Such a unique technology of Asia Cement can not only be applied to all cement ships in Asia Cement but also be introduced to other companies in the shipping business in the future for helping to build low carbon green ports quite a meaningful prospect,"21

Among  which  an  operator  in  Hualien  warehousing  and  shipping  station Yi  Chung  Chen  and  a  staff  Dong  Ho  Yu were all agreed that the shore power supply engineering is the global trend of harbor  transformation  Mr  Chen  said  that To cement industry not just mining and production the final shipping and selling is also  very important  Dong Ho Yu explained that On the average each day one Asia Cements ship will transport cement products from Hualien Plant to the northern central and southern harbors in Taiwan The loading and unloading efficiency ,"15
"
of cement ship while docking in the port is closely relating to the issues of energy cost and the impact to air quality,"21
"
Junior  Engineer  Jen  An  Chen  stated further that In the past while docking at piers ships were relying on fuel oil to generate  power  which  caused  larger  noises plus  the  emission  of  CO2  NOx  and  SOx pollutants Whereas after the completion of  shore  power  supply  system  all  power were supplied from shore for the use of the equipment onboard cement ship It can effectively reduce noises from ships and air pollution a meaningful move for assisting the building of low carbon green harbors,"21

An interview with Vice Director ofElectircal Instrument Team Chen Shuon Huang,"8
"
To most people Shore Power Supply Engineering indeed is an unfamiliar term to them Whereas it is one way to build a green harbor internationally ,"24
"
Chen  Shuon  Huang  expressed  that  generally  when  cargo ships  dock  at  the  pier  most  of  them  can  only  rely  on  the  fuel powered generator to supply power for the operation  Whereas  the  cement  ship  total  onshore  power  supply  system  completed  by  Asia  Cement  is  to  allow  the  cement  ship  not  to  use onboard  generator  at  all  to  provide  power  for  cement  loading and unloading and the use of cabin while it docks at the pier  It is switched to the onshore power supply system for the power needs which is stable and safe ,"24
"
It seems to be a simple theory but it is involved with a number of factors including the range of tide in the port the range and size of ports the designed specifications of the power supply system  on  various  ships  plus  the  sailing  schedule  of  different ships and weather conditions Hence it was highly difficult for the construction which is out of the imagination explained by him  The total shore power supply engineering is required to integrate the cement loading and unloading power supply system planned by Asia Cement team the cabin power supply systems designed  by  ship  builders  plus  the  different  power  equipment installed  in  the  cabins  of  four  cement  ships  due  to  the  different make dates  The technical team led by Chen Shuon Huang must  thoroughly  understand  the  generator  serial  and  parallel equipment in the cabins generator vvvf protective relay and ,"24
"
their power supply equipment and circuits  After overcoming all difficulties and completing the design work it must be verified by CR Classification Society a ship verification association  In addition the power system in each harbor is different and the power  used  for  loading  and  unloading  is  not  the  same  either thus  the  way  of  increasing  capacity  is  different    Asia  Cement had completed by itself all modifications and design work step by step For example the pier used by Asia Cement in Taichung harbor is not dedicated to Asia Cement the technical staffs designed a mobile flatcar which was conveniently used for placing and moving the cables of shore power system,"24
"
Huang stressed that the most technical skills needed for this construction was that the power supplied by the onboard generator  and  power  from  shore  power  supply  must  be  switched between  them  without  shutting  down  the  supplied  power  Asia Cement  developed  the  whole  technology  by  itself  without  requesting  any  help  from  foreign  companies  With  such  a  technical capability even during COVID19 pandemic period Asia Cement  was  still  able  to  continue  the  construction  of  cement ship total onshore power supply system without any influence,"24
"
Currently  all  generators  on  Asia  Cements  ships  are  shut down  during  the  period  of  docking  to  reduce  the  running  and wearing of equipment to extend the lifespan of use and to reduce  air  pollution  caused  by  fuel    Meanwhile  the  Company can  also  assign  the  saved  operational  manpower  to  do  other maintenance  work  to  optimize  human  resource  Furthermore ,"21
"
the unloading efficiency of the cement ships can be largely increased for example the unloading time was around 40 hours originally for some cement ships it only took about 20 hours after switching over to the shore power The transporting trips can be increased to largely elevate the transport capacity  Although it was a hard work during the construction Huang said proudly After the mission was completed all colleagues were full of the sense of achievements they all indicated that all of the effort was much worthwhile,"24

"
The target of air pollution matter SOx emission reduction was not reached in 2021 the cause was that in 2021 the content of ferric sulfide in limestone raw material was relatively high Hualien Plant planned to increase the use of alternative fuel to reduce the use of coal in order to reduce the emission of SOx The Plant will successively continue to closely monitor the status of air pollution emission and evaluate the improvement in future years,"21

In  recent  years  owing  to  the  rise  of  the awareness  on  environmental  protection  all cement  manufacturers  are  inevitably  bearing the  original  sin  of  high  carbon  emission  and high  energy  consumption    However  many people ignored that cement is actually needed and in existance in the daily life  Asia Cement faces this destiny but refuses to accept it  It works very hard to change the impression of the  general  public  to  cement  through  professional skills to tell the society that there is an infinite possibility to merge cement manufacturers and environment,"24
