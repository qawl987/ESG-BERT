22 Climate Change Strategies According to the Sixth Assessment Report of the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC AR6 issued in 20212022 global temperature has increased by about 11C from 18501990 Climate change also frequents and intensifies extreme weather events including extremely high temperatures on land and at sea extreme rainfall drought and wildfire To lessen climate change greenhouse gas GHG emissions must be reduced roughly by half by 2030 netzero emissions must be realized by 2050 and negative carbon technology must be used so that the goal of controlling temperature rise within 15 degree Celsius can be achieved,25
In response to the Paris Agreements goal limiting global temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 15 degrees the supervisory authorities of countries are strengthening their GHG emission reduction efforts Taiwan also declared Net Zero 2050 as a development goal in 2021 and planned to amend the Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act into the Climate Change Response Act The Legislative Yuan has begun review in 2022 and the amendment is expected to strengthen climate change management It will also help drive the development of a low carbon economy such as renewable energy green building and replacing old equipment,25

Natural disasters impair the value of collaterals or impact customers operations eg due to shortage of water or electricity disrupting the supply chain and therefore pushing up the credit risks,17
Extreme weather impacts macroeconomic factors eg GDP unemployment rate or physical risk events adversely impacting our investment targets eg operating revenues decline additional operating cost and supply disruption and thereby causing a uctuation in the price of our investment position,18
Physical risks map of business locations,18
and main suppliers Using a geographic information system GIS which allows mapping harzard area and risk potential zones makes analyzing physical risk more efcint The visualized graphic presentation makes it easier to understand the risk prole which benets the formulation of management measures in response In scenario SSP585 for 20302050 the ood risk map for the Companys business locations and suppliers shows that among the Companys 207 business locations and 204 suppliers a total of 05 business sites only 1 is a selfowned building and 24 suppliers are located in highrisk areas relatively high hazard of torrential rain and located in a ood damage potential area subsequent mitigation measures or relocation will be planed according to the leaseuse period,17
Operating bases impacted by extreme weather eg severe typhoons torrential rains or droughts see their ofce buildings dormitories and equipment damaged and operations disrupted,13
Natural disasters damage the infrastructures eg electricity and network infrastructures and so are likely to disrupt services provisions,5
Carbon taxfee and carbon tariffs levied to encourage the transition to a low carbon economy adversely impact the nancial position of the high carbon emission industry the industry where carbon reduction is not likely and their related supply chains,12
The high carbonemission industry will face a rise in operating cost due to the burden of carbon fee cost and a chance that business transition may fail causing a uctuation in the price of our investment,18
The rise in energyconservation and carbonreduction investment eg using renewable energies or energyefcient equipment stacks up the cost,24
Suppliers pass on investment and carbonrelated costs due to transition increasing costs,17

Scenario analysis is the process of identifying and evaluating potential impacts for possible situations in the future within a specific scope when facing uncertain conditions ESUN conducts climate change scenario stress tests to identify climate risks and opportunities assess the potential financial impact of climate risks and assist strategic planning and risk management using a combination of shortterm and longterm methodologies to meet different management needs For shortterm risks within 1 year which are mainly financial risks and include climate change risks we consider key issues and use assessment results to manage risk appetite in daily operations For midterm and longterm risks we referenced scenarios of international organizations such as the IPCC International Energy Agency IEA and the Network for Greening the Financial System NGFS to determine the impact of climate change over a relatively long period,13
Including climate change risks into nancial stress tests of conventional risk management,13
so that risk assessment is more comprehensive We combined climate change risks with conventional financial stress tests The scenarios analyzed included a traditional evaluation of the impact of financial crisis and also considered the potential impact of climate change For example the physical risks caused by typhoons and flooding which are common natural disasters in Taiwan or the transition risks of carbon pricing policy and energy supply may have an impact on the overall economy within a short period of time Related effects are stressed through adjustments to macroeconomic metrics The stress test results and capital adequacy ratio are comprehensively evaluated and the control indicators are set The mechanism as mentioned above will be reviewed and revised annually and submitted to the Board of Directors for approval,13
Using climate change scenario stress tests to provide a reference for longterm risk strategies,13
The timing and the extent of the impact of climate change risk are highly uncertain and there are limited historical experience and analysis methods to follow The effect over a relatively long period must be considered so it is hard to use conventional risk analysis methods for assessment Due to the impact of climate change the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall have increased in Taiwan Extreme weather events may cause the value of the property provided to ESUN as collateral to be impaired and floods and droughts may impact the operations of companies that ESUN invested in or provided loans to impacting creditors rights As countries around the world step up control of GHG emissions and collect carbon feestaxes and tariffs if companies do not complete the transition in time then carbonrelated fees and the cost of GHG control will affect their profits causing financial institutions to sustain the higher risk of losses from investments and loans The climate change task force referenced climate scenarios released by international organizations and simulated primary risk factors of our exposure with guidance from external consultants and after discussions during internal expert meetings The simulations assessed the risk of climate change to provide a basis for decisionmaking,13
Scenario assumptions for the interdependence of physical and transition risks,18
Physical risks and transition risks are not two independent risks For example if the time of transition to a low carbon economy is too late it will cause physical risk to increase An ambitious lowcarbon transition can help mitigate physical risks but policies and carbonrelated costs will impose a more significant burden on companies If governments and companies face the issue of climate change negatively it may lead to the dilemma of facing high transition and physical risks at the same time in the future The scenario used for the climate change scenario stress test this year includes both physical risks and transition risks and integrates the impact of both risks to provide a more comprehensive risk assessment Scenario settings are summarized in the table as follows,13

help them through the transition By simulating our hypothetical future portfolio total asset value unchanged but lower proportion of loans and investments into high carbonemitting industries our calculations show that these management measures can reduce maximum expected losses by 69 in 2050 making our portfolio more resilient,3

241 ESUNs GHG Emission Structure In 2021 the UN COP26 reached the Glasgow Climate Pact the first climate agreement that specifies a plan to reduce the use of coal ESUN started with ourselves and took action To tackle the immense challenge of achieving netzero emissions ESUN started by understanding the current state of GHG emissions and taking inventory of our service locations and business operations We then set emission reduction targets in sequence taking concrete action which continuously keeps our philosophy of netzero emissions in mind when making investment and funding decisions including no longer providing project financing to coalfired power plants issuing zerocarbon mission credit cards and announcing our plan to phase out all coal investments by 2035,25
From 2014 onwards we have begun taking carbon inventory of our service locations In 2017 we expanded these operations to take inventory for 100 of our domestic and foreign sites The inventory included scope 1 direct greenhouse gas emissions including emissions from electricity generators natural gas company vehicles and firefighting equipment and scope 2 indirect greenhouse gas emissions from consuming electricity Considering the fact that the largest source of emissions for companies in the financial industry is investment and financing activities we adopted the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry issued by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials PCAF in 2020 to take carbon inventory for our material assets We used the ESG reports and CDP information published by our investees to calculate their GHG emissions For instance if the GHG emissions arising from the business operations of a customer are 1 million tons and loans and investments provided by ESUN account for 1 of said companys assets then we will recognize 10000 tons of GHG emissions as our scope 3 emissions According to this calculation method GHG emissions from our investment and financing activities account for over 98 of our annual total emissions,25
Note 1 Emissions from investments and nancing activities for 2018 and 2021 have been estimated based on the increases or,25

ESUNs ESG Sustainability Initiative Climate change not only has a serious impact on the real economy but has also become a key factor affecting business operations Governments and NGOs around the world even large transnational corporations have proposed mitigation measures and policies and many companies have begun to reduce carbon emissions calling for a joint response from the supply chain At this critical moment ESUN launched the ESG Sustainability Initiative Action Plan to combine the joint initiatives of likeminded partners The aim is to starting from ESUN influence corporate customers who will then exert their own influence on the supply chain and other stakeholders thereby jointly utilizing ESG influence to achieve the goal and vision of sustainable development,13
1 We held a press conference in February inviting 32 likeminded business partners to become joint signatories to longterm goals for energy conservation and carbon reduction and work together with ESUN to exert positive influence and promote environmental sustainability In addition a sustainability initiative section was established on the company website in October to share the ESG achievements of all signatories By sharing reallife cases we can gather collective intelligence unleash a stronger influence and encourage more companies to engage in learning and exchange thereby furthering ESG developments,3
2 In total five largescale forums were held to an audience of chairmen and executive officers from listed companies and SMEs to guide them on applying ESG concepts and in turn exert an impact on their business management,3
3 We established a project taskforce and engaged in ESG issues,10
with enterprises By the end of the year ESUN has engaged with 46 enterprises including large enterprises and SMEs to share our experiences in ESG transformation and inform them of the ESG financial products and services that we provide to encourage and facilitate corporate transformation Sustainable financial products include sustainabilitylinked loans green loan and green bonds In addition we also recommended thirdparty consultants who are capable of assisting enterprises in preparing sustainability reports or in investigating carbon inventory Additionally ESUN used emails to communicate with 52 corporate debtors in ESG issues focusing particularly on those in carbonintensive industries eg oil and gas electronic manufacturing cement papermaking and steel We shared our sustainability practices and gave them suggestions hoping that these companies would strive toward net zero goal and reinforce their ESG management mechanisms,3

Accomplishments in Risk Management in,18
awareness Extend risk horizon through training,18
To raise risk awareness and to systematically extend the risk horizon ESUN ensures that every ESUN employee starts learning about ESUNs core philosophy regarding risk discipline and process since the rst day on the job ESUN employees in different departments and at different stages of their careers are also provided with appropriate education and training on risk management,18
On top of physical courses ESUN also draws on digital technology to organize online training or tests In particular the Covid19 pandemic prompted the introduction of a wide range of online training and interactive courses in 2021 A total of 3661 ESUN employees completed risk management training by taking both elearning and physical courses Of the trainees 97100 passed the elearning tests conducted afterwards Separately the Companys Risk Management Division publishes a quarterly bulletin to introduce the latest risk management regulations trends or practices From time to time departments responsible for product lines also offer educational materials for internal training at business units,18
In devising regulations for evaluation the Company places special emphasis on considering performance in both business endeavors and risk management Of the three key gauges for evaluating employee performance core and management competences takes account of awareness of risk management and the three lines of defense model as well as risk control in daily operations Likewise risk management is a key measure for evaluating the performance of senior managers A well dened reward and penalty scheme is thus adopted to incentivize managers and highperforming employees to strive for risk management over the long term thereby bolstering the Companys risk awareness throughout,18
2021 Reporting Mechanisms and Communication Channels,12
To undertake risk management efciently in a timely manner ESUN has established a series of reporting mechanisms and communication channels Upon detecting risk events or potential risks in daily operations employees are encouraged to notify departmental supervisors right away They can also present risk management observations and recommendations in work journals In 2021 a total of 1215 work journal entries had to do with risk management or internal control with 69 coming with specic suggestions All ESUN departments are supposed to conduct risk management and internal control selfevaluation each quarter In 2021 the Risk Management Division analyzed more than 3000 evaluation reports from product lines based on which it went on to compile the most important and common risk types and cases for presentation to managers and mid ranking ofcers during ESUN Banks annual conference At years end the Company routinely conducts a survey to canvass the opinions of all employees Of the 6942 questionnaires thus collected in 2021 148 touched on risk management The Chief Risk Ofcer and the Risk Management Division then went on to make improvement based on survey results report this to the President and other senior managers and respond by videoconference to employees who had given their opinions previously,18
Introduced IRB across the board Rened PD LGD and EAD credit rating models to ensure their compliance with applicable regulations and capacity for differentiation Credit rating results were applied to assignment of lending authority and responsibility interest pricing ceiling management postlending management and performance assessment Reports on applications of the aforesaid credit rating models were presented to the Board of Directors and Risk Management Committee on a regular basis,12
Beginning in 2021 IRB was ushered in on top of the standardized approach for calculating riskweighted assets so as to help all departments get hold of risks in their respective operations Meanwhile risk appetite and concentration management was implemented on a regular basis to ensure that the Bank does not go beyond the maximum risk exposure commensurate with its business goals,18
The market risk management mechanism comprises market risk and asset and liability management In anticipation of the 2022 migration away from LIBOR the said mechanism was modied to accommodate the use of alternative reference rates in product rating and risk assessment Meanwhile the system for verifying the product rating model underwent review with a view to rening its capacity for both preverication and subsequent periodic review Separately an optimized ALM system was adopted to simulate the interest rate and cash ow types of every transaction and predict the Banks overall asset and liability position net interest income and liquidity shortfall Simulation results were then used for the reference of business development strategies and asset and liability risk management,18
Under the new standardized approach toward managing operational risk a set of operating procedures was implemented for loss provisions and subsequent handling to enhance the efciency in capital utilization Any loss derived from operational risk was accounted for under a tting accounting entry and linked to the new system for reporting operational risk incidents This laid a solid foundation for full compliance with the new standardized approach for operational risk capital calculation Separately pertinent departments in the headquarters were asked to monitor and analyze various business risk indicators on a regular basis and le reports to both management and the Board of Directors,18
ESUN employees completed risk management training by taking both elearning and physical courses,18
work journal entries had to do with risk management or internal control,18
The World Economic Forums Global Risks Report 2022 brings to light how the Covid19 pandemic of the past couple of years has exerted a social and economic impact far greater than what many would normally associate with a worldwide epidemic Social cohesion and peoples mental health were adversely affected while wealth gaps technological inequality and the digital divide worsened,18

Overheating Asset prices soar rapidly leading to customers overinating investment and thus creating an inherent risk of a big drop going forward,4
Asset Devaluation A market collapse is set off by greatly inated asset prices or massive scal andor monetary stimulus Market liquidity tightens and overall interest rate risk increases thus undermining investment positions,18
Direct Impact A decline in market liquidity readily results in economic losses by pushing capital costs and interest rate risk higher And the worstcase scenario is an estimated loss of around NT55 billion,18
Devaluation of Customer Assets A market collapse is set to incur asset losses for customers This will surely undermine wealth management business and even disrupt capital allocations among businesses thereby hurting asset quality at large,18
Exposure Limits In addition to investment the Company will expand the range of business dealings with customers to prevent excessive concentration This will be supplemented by the Companys regular examination of LCR control and exposurelimit management,18
EarlyWarning Mechanism Regarding industry trends we have conducted video conference training for about 4000 people for one hour per week in all branches Establish an investment research center and an earlywarning mechanism to predict the probability of major nancial events simulate possible scenarios and specify types of properties suitable for investment Also put in place are monitoring and control of such properties downside risk and followup tracking of the investment portfolios performance and status of debts affected,18
After our evaluation process we identied certain emerging risks Further more we assess their short term and long term impact and develop mitigating actions and responsive policy,18
Economic Weakening With debts piling up across the global nancial system and ination running high central banks resort to monetary tightening and thus send business costs skyrocketing Export orders and new businesses contract and wage growth slows thereby undermining consumer spending,12
Direct Impact A spike in overall credit risk led to contraction in investment and nancing positions and drops in business volumes and earnings With debt collections in doubt and credit costs rising the worstcase scenario is an estimated loss of around NT215 billion,18
Purchase Intention Cardholders tend to spend less and it is increasingly difficult for the Companys contracted vendors to stay in business thereby reducing partner channels potential customers and hence earnings,4
Strengthening Management Enforce risk control by drawing on the Companys lending policy industry management and casebycase review Rene credit rating and lossfromdefault models to better reect borrower risk and assess lending risk more efciently,18
Service Diversication Offer greater payment conveniences to convince customers to conduct daily transactions with credit cards or mobile payment Make inroads into the environmental protection and education sectors over the long term,4

Transition Risk The international community has adopted policies to reduce GHG emissions and phase out fossil fuels The US Japan Korea and other countries are considering taking their lead from the EU to levy carbon duties Taiwans draft Climate Change Response Act also includes a carbon levy and these related might increase the negative impact of the nance by cost rise of client also lead to nancial asset Impairment,25
Physical Risk Global warming has brought about extreme climate events such as cold fronts wild res heavy rainfall and droughts and would disrupted to clients and ESUNs operation even more expense from the damage of equipment and the impairment of value of collateral affects the debt security,13
Climate disasters affect bank operations Due to extreme weather employees commute or branches interrupt which may lead to client complaints and losses of business opportunities and will increase maintenance costs from the damage of branches,13
Default of credit clients and loss of investment position evaluation Corporate customer operations are impacted by climate change transition risk or physical risk or due to lack of lowcarbon transformation capabilities resulting in loan default or decline in market value resulting in deterioration of asset quality or risk of falling investment target prices,13
Risk pricing bias Investment and credit analysis mostly rely on historical data and experience Climate risk has a longterm and complex impact on corporate customers which makes nancialrisk assessment more difcult which may lead to biased credit risk pricing and investment and nancing decisions making it impossible to take risks,18
Netzero carbon emissions in nancial industry lead to clients churn and increased costs In response to international trends and policy directions ESUN announce will achieve net zero by 2050 However since our main business is concentrated in Taiwan and Asia the awareness and regulations related to climate change in Europe and the United States are still in their infancy and the opportunity to reduce nance emissions is more limited limit The decarbonization process of the asset portfolio will limit investment and nancing targets resulting in the loss of business opportunities High communication cost of negotiation is high may affect the clients relationship and even cause the loss of clients Green premiums and carbon offsets for green assets will also increase costs and affect protability,13
Cost of Financial supervision has rise To strengthen climate supervision the competent authority may take more ambitious measures such as enhancing the control of specic industriesgeographical areas increasing the provisions or Risk weighted assets etc Financial and business models may need to modify to respond,18

The Taiwan government promotes the nations digital transformation and launches a blueprint for nancial technology and let clients data nancial trading information and system infrastructure in nancial industry more easily to expose in high potential risk This makes the nancial industry more targeted by hackers to obtain a large amount of clients data and conduct commercial extortion,1
Information Sharing Problems in the transmission process of online application services such as credit card and credit loan applications lead to data tampering by hackers leakage of a large number of shared data or abnormal operation of the online banking system,1
Cloud Services If clients device is implanted by a Trojan horse or defrauded by a phishing website the bank account password information may be leaked or even the account funds will be stolen,1
Information Leakage of bank account Information Leakage of clients personal data or nancial trading record from information sharing and cloud services will not only undermine ESUNs reputation but also damage to the rights and interests of cooperative of sharing institutions and even let clients data been sold or extorted by hackers,1
Systematic AnomaliesDisruptions Hackers take advantage on the design features of the cloud service architecture and focus on the relevant services provided by the nancial industry in the cloud resulting in service anomaliesinterruptions and even counterfeiting clients transactions stealing clients account balances causing client to have poor perception of the ESUNs system stability and loss of rights and interests damage,1
LongTerm Impact Faulty upkeep of clients personal information and failure to keep operational systems running smoothly are likely to make them reluctant to entrust information to ESUN and use its digital services going forward This will surely deal a heavy blow to the Banks business development in the days ahead,22

ESUN FHC Sustainability Report 2021,15
Completed the First Green Energy Wheeling A Milestone Closer to 100 Renewable Energy,24
ESUN supports net zero emissions and declared that it will use 100 renewable energy by 2030 increasing the percentage of renewable energy by 10 each year to gradually reach the goal By building solar power equipment and purchasing green energy the first green energy wheeling project was completed in 2021 The annual energy production of solar power projects that have already completed energy wheeling has reached 425 million kWh or 10 of the annual power consumption The companys model zerocarbon Chiayi Branch and the soontoopen second headquarters building will be the first to start using green energy,24
ESUN began planning the procurement of renewable energy early 2020 and started by analyzing its electricity consumption We then discussed suitable sites and electricity generation methods with external power companies We signed an electricity purchase agreement after numerous meetings and finally completed the first renewable energy wheeling in December 2021 after completing the review process of Taiwan Power Company Bureau of Energy local government and Bureau of Standards Metrology and Inspection,24
Reached an important milestone of RE100 Renewable energy purchased by ESUN accounts for approximately 18 of annual,24
Understand the current renewable energy purchase process and pain points of companies Accelerates the adoption of renewable energy and allows electricity purchase,24
experience to be shared with customers,15
Combine renewable energy with chargers encourage customers and employees to use electric vehicles and develop cities,24
that are friendly to electric vehicles,24
Governments around the world are providing purchase subsidies and tax reductions to encourage citizens to use electric vehicles due to the rising awareness of environmental protection According to the path to net zero emissions in 2050 announced by the National Development Council electric vehicles will account for 100 of newly sold vehicles in 2040 to reduce carbon emissions in the transportation sectors Besides providing subsidies or discounts improving the environment for electric vehicles by increasing the number of chargers is the only way electric vehicle drivers will not be anxious about charging which will increase their willingness to use electric vehicles and popularize electric vehicles faster,12
ESUN began planning the installation of electric vehicle chargers in 2020 After careful evaluation of charging efficiency universality of equipment and actual usage we installed 6 sets of chargers in each of the parking lots of two office buildings in Taipei City in March 2021 for use by customers and employees Furthermore the installation of chargers is expected to increase electricity consumption of ESUNs office buildings by 2 ESUN is also actively engaging in energy transformation and successfully completed renewable energy wheeling in two office buildings at the end of 2021 combining green transportation with renewable energy to lay the foundation for zero carbon transportation ESUN works with customers and employees to implement low carbon concepts in their behavioral model developing cities friendly to electric vehicles,24
Improved the usage environment for electric vehicles Installed 12 electric vehicle chargers,24
Responded to electricity consumption of transportation through,24
energy transformation Completed renewable energy wheeling in office buildings that installed chargers,24
Worked together with customers and employees to implement low,4
carbon transportation The parking lots of office buildings have chargers for customers and employees to use,19
Use renewable energy by 2030,24

Using ecofriendly plastic materials to make envelope lm using innovative technologies to realize a circular economy Envelopes are a frequently used product by financial institutions including reconciliation statements for customers to verify their transaction information credit card statements and various notices However the transparent film on conventional envelopes releases a large amount of GHG that damages the environment in the production process and after being incinerated ESUN began working with envelope suppliers in 2021 to use biomass plastic for the transparent film to support environmental sustainability The biomass plastic received the USDA 100 Certified Biobased Product label which has the highest creditability in the world Biomass plastic is an ecofriendly plastic material made from nonedible corn and tapioca powder Carbon emissions from the production process decreases from 324kg CO2e to 062kg CO2e per kilogram compared with plastic Biomass plastic does not generate toxic substances when incinerated and carbon dioxide absorbed in its growth process is released back to nature when it is incinerated which is part of the natural carbon cycle Hence this portion of carbon emissions does not need to be calculated in GHG emissions significantly lowering the damage to the environment compared with conventional envelopes Ecofriendly envelopes are currently used for reconciliation statements Besides continuing to promote electronic statements we also plan to expand the scope of ecofriendly envelopes Using the approximately 1563 million reconciliation statements mailed by ESUN each month we expect to reduce carbon emissions by 98136kg CO2 each year Environmental protection is an international common issue ESUN selected ecofriendly materials for envelopes commonly used for customers to reduce the environmental damage caused by waste and also exerted influence on envelope suppliers to promote the use of ecofriendly envelopes in even more industries contributing to a sustainable future,19

Under the current wave of globalization and internationalization bilingual education has become one of the nations important policies ESUN supportive of the education for rural children has heard from many principals and teachers that the English proficiency of schoolchildren is exhibiting an Mshaped distribution especially in rural areas The main reasons are the long term shortage of English teachers in rural areas and the inability of rural families to pay for cram schools School children once fall behind or have negative experiences with learning English may carry a negative attitude towards English furthermore it could be difficult to carry out proficiency levelbased grouping or remedial teaching due to lack of teachers,2
