Qisda Green Product Evolutional Phases,15,26,diff,empty,,
We introduced green design IEC 62430 in 2010 and continued to promote the thinking of product life cycle asking to implement green elements at the source of design to lower the environmental impacts and risks of the products at each phase of product life cycle for products and components we design while achieving a simple design In 2013 we incorporated ecological design in quality management producing products that can both help the environment and have good functions We thereby,15,6,diff,,,
introduced integrative design ISO 14006 incorporating green design IEC 64230 environmental management system ISO 14001 and quality management system ISO 9001 in the RD ow forming a structure that integrates ecological design,23,11,diff,,,
In 2013 we started obtaining integrative design ISO 14006 and green design IEC 62430 declarative statements for products such as display projector smart phone scanner multimedia player and lamp,15,24,diff,,,
I Ecological Design GuidelineDirection Qisda requires that we should implement greendesign thinking at the initial phase of product RD to lower the environmental impacts and risks of the products at each phase of product life cycle for products and components we design and perform a fair management at the source of design Therefore we set up a crossBU green design guideline according to the design experience and current status of each production line offering RD staff the direction of green design and related manufacturing procedure process choice,15,9,diff,,,
For the design RD stage we focus on our four green design directions Reduce Volume Manage Hazardous Substance Preserve Energy and Recycle Related actions and results are as follows,19,19,,,,
The goals and results of 20162020 are compared with that in 2015 If comparing the 2015 results with that in 2009 we preserved energy by 4542 reduced volume by 2296 reduced carbon by 3203 in 2015,24,24,,,,
Volume reduction aspect covers reducing volume weight or products and packages as well as number of components of products,15,19,diff,,,
Since we are a professional OEM we manufacture electronic prodcuts for brands or other customers the calculation of prouct carbon footprints do not include usage and discard phases,24,21,diff,,,

Qisda Product Life Cycle Thinking,15,26,diff,empty,,
We mainly consider reducing the volume and weight of products and packages as well as the number of components of products while designing with modules In 2020 the average weight reduction of each product line was 2642,15,19,diff,,,
For products that might use chemical substances during production process that might affect the environmental safety we compile the Hazardous Chemical Substance Control List according to the requirements of international regulations and customers With strict control in recognizing component materials and inspection on nished products we ensure our products meet the requirements of international regulations and customers by a systematic management mechanism We expect to reduce usage of hazardous chemical substances each year while avoiding harms done to human bodies and the environment by products when delivered used and discarded,14,19,diff,,,
We focus on the improvement of energy efficiency30 and lowering of energy consumption during standby mode while comparing the data of models of the current generation with that of the previous one to verify whether energy preservation performance is reached Besides meeting international requirements such as ErP TCO Total Cost of Ownership and Energy Star Qisda upholds the purpose consideration and model of self and constant improvements In 2020 the average energy preservation was 2506,24,24,,,,
We consider the produce recycling rate and disassembling difficulty at the design phase We should consider the product joining method at the beginning of design avoiding materials and manufacturing procedure process not easy to disassemble such as glue weld or embed For products and samples with plastic components larger than 25g there should be a label marking materials used while adopted plastic components should not mix more than two kinds of materials,15,15,,,,
II Product Ecological Design Flow,15,26,diff,empty,,
To realize ecological design for all models and meet the requirements of customerscountries of sales while continuing to promote volume reduction energy preservation and carbon reduction the design ow of models can be divided into the following three phases,24,25,diff,,,
III Product Environment Risk Assessment,15,10,diff,,,
At the middlephase of design we use the internal WEEE Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive 200296EC platform to assess the product recycling rate and assess whether the rate reaches the required base line before entering the next design phase,19,19,,,,
In addition to meeting the demands from customers and countries of sales Qisda proactively assess whether our products can have more simplied designs to cut down unnecessary manufacturing procedures and components Annual audits are administered to assess the environmental impacts of individual product category including the design,15,9,diff,,,

Design check Verify again the difference between the design layout and prototype and its s well as identify quality issues if any,15,6,diff,,,
Ecological design level assessment Understand whether we meet the demands from other international requirements on the basis that we meet requirements of customers and countries of sales The ecological design status of a product will be ranked gold silver and bronze while an analysis on its design strength and weakness will be provided for nextgeneration products as references,15,4,diff,,,
Hazardous substance control Based on customer demands provide relevant reports and audits to verify the conformity of all components to customer requirements,19,19,,,,
Product recycling ratedisassemble report Generate the recycling rate and disassemble analysis reports by using the internal WEEE platform,15,19,diff,,,
Product life cycle assessment The internalexternal information is collected through the carbon management platform in Qisda Right after a products mass production the product carbon footprint report and recommended carbon reduction list will be provided,15,25,diff,,,
Green design performance The evaluation of current products and comparison between models of the current and previous generations will be conducted to assess the degree of achievements to the goals of energy preservation volume reduction and carbon reduction,15,25,diff,,,

Since 2010 we have compiled green design goals Entering the eighth year we discovered,15,26,diff,empty,,
levels of bottlenecks will be encountered amid continued volume reduction energy,18,19,diff,,,
preservation and improving recycling rate This may affect the product itself The survival of,15,19,diff,,,
a company is protability it must survive so that it can continue to promote sustainability,15,0,diff,,,
Therefore we have reconsidered the original meaning of sustainable development,10,4,diff,,,
anticipating our products to gain a balance between the environment and economy,15,26,diff,empty,,
When being friendly to the environment we need to have enough prots As a result we,10,26,diff,empty,,
adopt the thinking of ecological benets continuing to improve product efficiency on,15,20,diff,,,
condition that no burden is added on the environment We also strive to lower burden,12,26,diff,empty,,
on the environment for existing products while further set the goal at 5 in 2020 for,15,26,diff,empty,,
increasing the sustainable value of products In 2020 an increase of 4483 in ecological,15,26,diff,empty,,
benets was observed for all production lines,24,26,diff,empty,,
In 2010 Qisda established the benchmark carbon management platform in the industry It,18,11,diff,,,
integrated the BOM system to expand into corresponding components while collecting,12,26,diff,empty,,
information on materials and manufacturing parameters by combining the component,15,15,,,,
recognition system Before the mass production of products such information can be entered,15,8,diff,,,
into the Simapro system to create product carbon footprint reports This greatly shortens,15,24,diff,,,
the operational time immediately after the mass production instead of six months It also,24,26,diff,empty,,
expanded from one model to other product lines and models for generating carbon check,15,21,diff,,,
reports As a result we have included carbon footprint reports in 100 of our major models,25,24,diff,,,
since 2012 In the future we look forward to integrating the information of the product,15,26,diff,empty,,

Water Resource Risk Assessment Table,20,10,diff,,,
Qisdas manufacturing procedures dont require water consumption but we need to provide clean drinking water for employees We use the WRI World Resources Institute Aqueducts global water risk mapping tool to analyze results Taiwan and Suzhou China factories are located in areas of midlevel water shortage risks However water consumption of all factories only comes from municipal water supply For the past 15 years only one incident of water supply shortage occurred We already set up an emergency response ow for water shortage If we receive notication from the government or if there is media report about recent water source becoming muddy due to typhoons or if there is drought and causes temporary water supply suspension or rationing we will notify contract water wheels to supplement the insufficient amount of water to avoid production line halts due to water shortage,20,20,,,,
All factory water consumption comes from municipal water supply no underground water is abstracted for operations we adopt ltering equipment for drinking water and inspect regularly according to regulations to ensure the water quality is safe,20,20,,,,

The water pollution prevention equipment at the Taiwan plant is operated and maintained by professional staff We use the biolm treatment system to deal with domestic sewage whereas the water generated is discharged into the management system of the sewage sewer of the government The sewage of the Suzhou plant is directly discharged into the municipal sewer system with the nal destination being the sewer management system Therefore there will be no direct inuence on the water body and land due to sewage created by water consumption Also the effluent water quality is monitored regularly and inspected according to regulations The results are better than the regulated standards For the previous years there were no water pollution incidents at each factory,20,20,,,,
According to the WRI Aqueduc ts global water risk mapping tool analysis Taiwan and Suzhou factories are not in areas with high ood risks In the past 15 years there were no losses due to oods at factories Also we set up controlling ows such as prevention and emergency response Before typhoons we will ask cleaning staff to specically clean ditches to facilitate drainage avoiding factory oods due to impeded drainage We also prepare in advance emergency equipment such as sandbag and ood control gate for emergency,5,9,diff,,,
At the end of each quarter we regularly inspect the compliance state of waterrelated regulations If there are any updates of regulations we immediately respond to them Recently there were no related illegal incidents about water at factories,20,20,,,,
No matter in Suzhou China or Taiwan water expenses are low Taiwan has not started collecting water consumption expenses Since our factories do not consume much water the inuence on costs in the future will be very low,20,20,,,,
