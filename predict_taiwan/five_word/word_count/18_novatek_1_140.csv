The original performance of financial results was adjusted based on the name of the material issue of the industry,18,8,diff,,,
Since RD and innovation are important capabilities for IC design the original provision of innovative servicesproducts was adjusted based on the name of the material issue of the industry,15,3,diff,,,
The original risk management and prevention mechanism was adjusted based on the name of the material issue of the industry,18,9,diff,,,

Description of value chain stages,17,26,diff,empty,,
To obtain semiconductor raw materials such as silicon ingots and related precious metals from suppliers it is necessary to confirm that the source of minerals is not from areas with high risk of conflict and comply with RBA regulations,17,7,diff,,,
Design ICs in accordance with the characteristics of different products and their functions to meet market needs in addition to focusing on innovative RD and intellectual property protection we also pursue environmental performance such as product energy efficiency and hazardous substance management etc and propose lowcarbon solutions,15,9,diff,,,
Wafers of different sizes are cut based on the IC design They are then packaged after the usability test to become ICs for electronic products It is necessary to manage social issues such as the source of raw materials workplace safety and human rights protection as well as environmental issues such as the use of energy water resources and chemical substances in order to establish a stable and responsible supply chain,10,9,diff,,,
Including final product assembly consumer use and product recycling as well as disposal in addition to focusing on product market value and user experience it is also important to carry out product life cycle management such as energy efficiency and recyclability,15,19,diff,,,

Before improvement The original operation mode designed for the Building is that when the chiller of a household starts to supply cooling water the chiller pump and cooling water pump of that household must be turned on The total horsepower of the pumps is 545HP and the annual power consumption is 2374369 kWhyear,24,20,diff,,,
The Tai Yuen building is equipped with a central air conditioning system and cooling water towers are used for heat dissipation Cooling water pipelines are connected in parallel to remove heat Cooling water towers are activated as required by chiller loading and the fans are controlled based on the outlet water temperature The cooling water towers power consumption is 137234 kWh per year,24,20,diff,,,
Through serial and parallel connection of vertical and horizontal pipelines to all offices the chillers were integrated to form a multipleunit connected chiller system which allows crossfloor operations to improve chiller utilization rates In addition chiller loading was changed to a two way mode and dynamic balancing valves automatic load flow control were added to improve chiller utilization rates Furthermore water volume can be balanced automatically depending on loading to solve the problem of vertical cooling water distribution Postimprovements the system can decide whether to increase or decrease the number of chillers in operation based on the sites actual temperature and flow volume Post improvements the chillers maintain highload operating rates of 80100 with operating based on demand to not waste energy,24,20,diff,,,
