Laptop Market Due to the spreading of COVID19 in 2020 peoples lives and work around the world have experienced changes resulting in the increasing need for work from home WFH distance learning and home entertainment Consequently the notebook NB industry that had experienced maturity in the product life cycle was infused with new opportunities in turn generating new growth peaks,15,4,diff,,,
Generally speaking the global demand for NBs was high in 2020 Although the strong demand was complicated by a severe shortage of key components such as 8inch wafer IC and display panels Quanta demonstrated remarkable delivery every quarter to set record highs According to DIGITIMES research report 201 million NBs were shipped globally in 2020 setting an alltime high since 2011 exhibiting a growth of 25 compared to 2019,15,4,diff,,,
Unlike traditional business models in the NB industry distance education emerged to contain the spread of the pandemic hence the need for educational mobile computers worldwide spiked with Googles Chrome OS and Chromebook being the biggest beneficiaries of remote education Googles Chrome OS has been engaged in the education market for some time hence it possesses comprehensive cloud resources in the US education market With diverse packages offered by telecom service providers the shipping of Chromebook increased significantly in 2020 The most noticeable procurement project is the Japanese governments GIGA School Global and Innovation Gateway for All which aims to equip every elementary school and junior high school students in the country with an NB before 2024 However due to the COVID19 pandemic the target was reached in advance by the Japanese government in 2021 driving the explosive growth of Chromebook in 2020,2,3,diff,,,
In terms of the NBs key component the CPU the largest supplier Intel has experienced production process glitches hence a small hap has developed for its mainstream products As a result its NB market share has declined year after year reaching 75 by the end of 2020 Its competitor AMD however rose to the occasion and exhibited growth every year reaching 20 market share by Q4 of 2020 On the other hand MediaTek Qualcomm and Apple have perceived the growth potential of the costcompetitive ARM architecture CPU developing new CPUs for the market to expand their NB market share For example Apple released its first M1 ARM architecture CPU powered NB in 2020 which proved to be very popular on the market In general the market gap unfilled by Intel CPU combined with the involvement of other prominent CPU manufacturers in the market has resulted in major changes in the Inteldominated NB CPU market According to DIGITIMES research the shipping of Intel CPUs is likely to plummet below 70 for the first time in 2021 due to the largescale adoption of AMD and ARM CPUs by the market,15,4,diff,,,
Combining all of the above in terms of the global sales pattern of NB in 2020 business NBs demonstrated a slight increase while the shipping of educational NBs has been increased considerably At the same time since people are spending more time at home coupled with the US governments subsidies in reviving the economy consumers are encouraged to purchase more consumer electronics particularly NBs with larger screens therefore consumer NBs originally forecasted to exhibit poor performance also increased in sales,12,8,diff,,,
In terms of the NB market different manufacturers held their respective key advantages in the consumer business and eSports sector showing more maturity and stability in market segmentation and the industry chain However unlike previous years the surging demand in educational NBs has led various brands to vie for market shares hence their rankings fluctuate every quarter In summary the top 3 performers in the global NB market in 2020 were still HP Lenovo and Dell,4,4,,,,
Market for cloud computing businesses In terms of the cloud market in response to the COVID19 pandemic prevention needs cloudrelated industries exhibited an extraordinary growth rate in 2020 According to Synergy Research Groups latest statistics the total number of data centers for hyperscale service providers had increased to 600 by the end of 2020 Q4 doubling the 2015 figure and it is expected to maintain strong growth in 2021 Based on global IT research and advisory firm Gartners predictions the investment in global data centers will reach US200 billion by 2021 an increase of 6 over the previous year The US still represents 39 of the worlds demand for cloud computing and Internet data centers but areas such as Europe the Middle East and the Asia Pacific have all sustained high levels of growth These products are also highly popular in China Japan the UK Germany and Australia which aggregately account for 29 of total demand New data centers were commissioned in 17 different countries and regions in the last 4 quarters and most of which were located in the US South Korea China Canada United Arab Emirates Indonesia Italy and South Africa Amongst hyperscale service providers Amazon Microsoft and Google accounted for more than half of new data centers whereas Oracle Alibaba and Facebook are also proactively building data centers,1,4,diff,,,
In light of the pandemics impact to reduce the risks associated with disasters in the future both the public and private sectors are beginning to engage in Business Continuity Planning The advantages of a cloudbased IT structure such as agility elasticity serviceability and innovation are consistent with the needs of the trend Hence it has become a great tool for supporting continuity plans including WFH and the core of hyperscale service cloud data centers design Quanta has always been dedicated to improving the design of hyperscale cloudbased data centers offering standardized open data center products and optimizing performance in terms of efficiency elasticity reliability manageability serviceability and the optimization of data centers of various service nature and workload Worldrenowned research institutions have identified Cloud Analytics Mobile and Social CAMS as the 4 main trends of the future These trends will change the existing IT infrastructure forcing businesses to adopt an AIdriven and cloudbased IT infrastructure as a means of supporting innovation and competitiveness,18,22,diff,,,
The postpandemic telecom industry will face network transformation the emergence of Open RAN and corporate digitization According to GSMAs Global Mobile Trends 2021 report the 5G popularization timeline will coincide with that of the commercialization of Open RAN technology and over half of the telecom service providers are willing to include new suppliers in their 5G networks thereby introducing new energy to the information technology and communication technology suppliers in the 5G market,18,4,diff,,,
As the 5G standards and technology become more mature consumers are already accustomed to using mobile communication software social media and live streaming video services on their smart devices such as smartphones in turn increasing the penetration of smart devices and mobile communication networks in the global market It is within the expectation that all future smart devices will have mobile communication features built in one way or another Consumers also have a rising expectation for lower latency and higher bandwidth in the mobile networks they use which telecom service providers will have to respond by introducing edge computing technologies and services and redirect computing instructions to the edge network which in turn reduces core network load in favor of lowlatency applications such as VR AR IoV and IoT,1,8,diff,,,
