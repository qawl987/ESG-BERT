In 2021 a major COVID19 outbreak in Taiwan in May led to restrictions on peoples movements that affected domestic demand and employment in the second and third quarters but robust trade growth propelled by soaring demand from advanced economies more than offset the slowdown in private consumption Bolstered by strongerthanexpected net export and private investment growth Taiwans economy expanded during the year outperforming most other countries,4
In 2022 we expect the pace of Taiwans export growth to moderate because of a relatively high base of compar ison but private consumption should rebound as coronavirus fears ease and become a main driver of growth Those factors plus the localization of supply chains companies expanding production capacity and increased investment in green energy should help Taiwans economy perform well this year,17

The environmental and social externalities derived from companies opera tions have started to draw the attention of global investors Since 2020 Fubon Financial Holdings has joined with the Corporate Sustainability Impact Center at Tunghai University to create a sustainability impact management framework founded on a triple bottom line profit people and the planet The framework analyzes the interplay of economic environmental and social issues through cau salityoriented impact pathways and identifies the positive and negative poten tial and real and longterm and shortterm impacts of the Companys processes in those areas using a profitandloss mindset,10
In 2021 Fubon Financial Holdings value chain generated a net positive impact of NT10 trillion of which 97 came from financial products and services in vestments and loans Another 2 was derived from Fubons own operations and the remainder came from its upstream supply chain We created nearly 274 million jobs and NT13 trillion in wages through our investments and loans and supported output value more than NT9 trillion in the industrial chain However the consumption of raw materials and creation of environmental pol lution generated through the supply and demand sides of different industries led to NT5213 billion in social costs To reduce these negative impacts Fubon Financial Holdings has made it its mission to leverage its financial influence to broaden the impact of sustainable investment create longterm value for stake holders and be a force for good in society by weighting its investment portfolio and more effectively allocating its resources,17

In March 2022 Taiwans government issued a roadmap for netzero emissions called Taiwans Pathway to NetZero Emissions in 2050 to keep global temperatures from increasing by more than 15C Based on a scenario of electricity demand increasing 205 a year it proposed spending NT900 billion to promote an energy transition and expand the use of mature photovoltaic and wind technologies supplemented by geothermal power and marine energy so that renewable electricity accounts for 6070 of Taiwans electricity supply by 2050 According to the NetZero Trackers survey of 198 countries and the 2000 largest publiclytraded companies in the world by revenue 128 countries and 699 companies had announced netzero targets as of April 2022 Fueled by this trend away from carbon accelerating the transition to lowcarbon energy will become an increasingly pressing issue for global industries and companies,24
Using impact valuation methods we analyzed the volume of carbon emissions avoided by five renewable energies solar wind hydropower geothermal and biomass based on conditions in Taiwan and found that wind power prevented the most emissions Every NT1 million invested to build a wind power plant results in the avoidance of 41286 kilograms of emissions The next most efficient method was hydropower which avoids 34261 kilograms of carbon emissions per NT1 million in vested The analysis also discovered that the clean energy generated by wind power and hydropower could reduce to a relatively high degree the social costs needed to,21
remedy longterm climate or environmental problems known as the social cost of carbon 1 creating significant carbon reduction investment benefits The social cost of carbon avoided by wind power of NT62395 was the highest of any renewable energy source followed by hydropower at NT51778 indicating that investing in wind power and hydropower created more positive value for Taiwan than investing in solar or geothermal energy,13
In terms of Fubon Financial Holdings it invested nearly NT36 billion in renewable energy in 2021 more than triple the amount invested in 2020 This investment avoid ed 870000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions and created NT13 billion in carbon reduction benefits 2 in 2021 Investments in wind power and solar power contributed 572 and 381 of those benefits respectively,25
Renewable energy is a key element of Taiwans netzero ambitions Through impact valuation methodology Fubon is gaining insight into the carbon reduction benefits and real value created by different renewable technologies and expects to use it to inform its business strategies and impact investing initiatives Not only will this approach support the governments decarbonization policy and encourage renew able energy development in Taiwan but also create a positive benefit for society If netzero emissions by 2050 is the minimum that needs to be done to rescue the planet and the environment we need to be more aggressive in creating positive val ue to achieve the vision of a sustainable world,24
ESG definition 1 The social cost of carbon refers to the social costs incurred to deal with the longterm damage caused by climate change including asset and economic losses from natural disasters the damage to peoples health or the economic costs of energy transitions to keep temperatures from rising higher The average global social cost of carbon is US418 per metric ton Source Countrylevel Social Cost of CarbonDatabase Explorer,13
2 Indicates that the global economy can avoid NT13 billion in economic costs and help solve the environmental and social problems caused by carbon emissions,10
Note 1 The calculation of the annual power output from investment in renewable energy is based on a research report by the International Renewable Energy Agency it takes into account construction costs per unit of installed capacity and its capacity factor coefficient,24
Note 2 The calculation of the emissions avoided through investment in renewable energy was based on a Life Cycle Assessment model For Taiwan the analysis compared the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that could be avoided through the generation of electricity by renewable energy facilities relative to the general electricity grid hybrid grid,25
Note 3 The calculation of carbon reduction benefits from investment in renewable energy was based on a 2016 United States Environmental Protection Administration report Emissions avoided were converted into relative social cost of carbon values Note 4 When an investment could not be broken down into specific renewable energy sources solar energy was used as the default energy for calculation purposes,24

423 Netzero and Decarbonization Pathway In planning its decarbonization pathway Fubon pledged to the SBTi to use scientific methods to set carbon reduction targets for specific industries or corporate investment and loan portfolios for the next 10 to 15 years In 2021 it launched a project to do a carbon inventory and set carbon goals for its investment and financing positions and expects to for mally submit sciencebased carbon reduction targets to the SBTi for review by the third quarter of 2022 Through these efforts Fubon can play a central role in aligning capital flows with lowcarbon pathways and climate resilience,3
Taipei Fubon Bank considers regulatory policies on controlling greenhouse gas emissions when dealing with existing clients that operate public or private power plants run on coal or other fossil fuels or mining compa nies that extract coal or other fossil fuels Aside from understanding whether each client takes inventory of their GHG emissions the bank also evaluates their planning and execution of GHG emission reduction measures and targets as well as the impact and influence of regulatory policies on their operations and offers timely advice,25
and financing related to transitions of their businesses At the same time the bank has pledged no new financ ing for 1 overseas customers oil exploration and drilling operations 2 overseas clients vertical integration including oil explorationdrillingrefining and product sales 3 oil field services and pipelines and 4 petro chemical refineries Instead it hopes to use its financial clout to help these clients make lowcarbon transitions,3
Fubon formally announced in 2021 that it would not make any new loans to mining companies that only mine coal not make any new loans to or investments in power plants that generate more than 50 of their electricity from coal and not provide any new project financing to coalfired power plants In doing so it became the first domestic financial institution to pledge limits to investing in high carbon emission industries Management guidelines for investing in or financing high carbon emission industries such as thermal power generation and coal mining were also clearly laid out for the first time in the Fubon Financial Holding Co Ltd and Subsidiar ies Sustainable Finance Policy giving subsidiaries rules and guidelines they could follow consistently,12
Fubon Insurance currently uses engineering insurance to subject mining operators to some controls At the same time that it began supporting green energy development in 2017 it started to reduce its involvement in coalrelated engineering insurance in line with international trends To give companies time to go green and reduce their carbon footprints however it has taken the approach of gradually reducing the coverage it under writes for each policy and helps clients with insurance planning for their transition to green energy,12
To strengthen its sustainability practices and comply with the Principles for Responsible Investment Fubon Life incorporates environmental social and governance factors in the analysis and decisionmaking process for any investment It closely engages with investment targets and industry partners to more effectively ensure that re sponsible investment principles are being observed Those engagements are driven by Fubon Lifes compliance with principles 3 and 4 in its Stewardship Principles for Institutional Investors Compliance Statement in which it pledges to maintain appropriate dialogue and interaction with investee companies That is demonstrated through stewardship practices that include,12

In addition to ensure that this engagement is consistent with stewardship principles investment blacklist in dicators have been established that are used to screen investment targets before an investment is made If a violation of any of those indicators is discovered the investment should not be made After an investment is made it should be regularly tracked using internal ESG indicators such as whether the company has had envi ronmental or human rightsrelated violations or experienced serious labormanagement disputes If a company invested in has acted improperly on an ESG issue of importance to Fubon Life Fubon Life discusses the issue with the company and then assesses whether the engagement was successful If that company does not make the required improvements or has been involved in a major dispute or been fined by a regulatory authority or has been ruled by a court to have violated the law that company will be put on the blacklistexclusion list as soon as the court ruling related to the legal violation is final Consequently the amount of the investment in the company cannot be increased and shareholdings are to be gradually sold off,0
