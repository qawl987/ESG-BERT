TSMC is dedicated to reducing environmental and social impacts and introduced EPL in evaluate environmental externalities and resulting social costs created from the production process In 2019,10
TSMC further applied EPL to the upstream,25
supply chain converting the environmental impact generated from product life cycles into external social costs identifying signicant environmental impact factors to formulate improvement measures and reduce the environmental externalities and social costs generated from TSMC procurement,15
EPL analysis showed that TSMC experienced,18
In a minor increase in environmental externalities generated from production and operations which,24
is mainly caused by a growing demand for energy water and raw materials from the increasing number of new manufacturing facilities and evolution of advanced process technologies GHG emissions from TSMC facilities are the primary source accounting for which also include air pollution wastewater and incinerationburial of waste Across the supply chain TSMC conducted an environmental hotspot analysis of 149 1 suppliers and found that chemical suppliers,25
of TSMCs total environmental externalities,17
are the largest source of environmental externalities We further from the supply chain accounting for inspected critical raw material suppliers and found that sulfuric acid developers and ammonia solutions generated the largest number of environmental externalities out of all raw materials,17
TSMC continues to promote innovative green practices to continue reducing the environmental impact of we production processes in our facilities In successfully reduced environmental externalities per 2020 unit product by mainly by signicantly lowering GHG emissions We also witnessed a signicant increase in waste from various environmental externalities per unit product Unfortunately this is caused by new advanced processes and expanding capacity developing new processes and maintaining stable yield rates are challenging which has led to an increase in demand for raw materials and a signicant increase in waste TSMC has already built the worlds rst Zero Waste Manufacturing Center which will be 2023 operational starting in increase the recycling rate of chemical waste liquid,19
and achieve a circular economy model to reduce environmental externalities For sustainable supply chain management TSMC is employing environmental audits to help suppliers identify potential risks and ways to improve In and mainly uncovered chemical leaks to storm drains and failure to establish a GHG inventory and management system TSMC has requested all suppliers to establish a management system as well as reduction goals for energy water and GHG emissions to reduce environmental impact We aim to collaborate with suppliers to build a green lowcarbon supply chain to exert a positive inuence on society For more details 2021 please refer to the TSMC Loss EPL Report,25

Improve Measures of Sustainability Management,15
TSMC worked closely with supplier partners through the four guiding principles Compliance guidance Risk Assessment Audit Participation and Continuous Improvement to urge suppliers to continue improving commit to values and take the initiative to promote sustainable practices to their upstream suppliers To prompt common growth among supplier partners worldwide TSMC established the global responsible supply chain management platform Supply Online 360,17
It serves as an integrated communication channel,24
with all suppliers propelling tangible change with virtual data monitoring and bringing sustainable semiconductor supply chain practices into reality,17
Four Guiding Principles of Sustainable Supply Chain Management,17
Suppliers comply with the TSMC Supplier Code of Conduct and extend the scope of management to their upstream suppliers,17
Suppliers determine the level of Code compliance via Sustainability SelfAssessment Questionnaire or Sustainability Risk Assessment by the TSMC Team,17
Critical Suppliers are audited by RBAcertied thirdparty institutions or the TSMC Supplier Healthiness Assessment Rectication Program team conducting onsite audits,17
Suppliers implement improvement measures according to the audit results and receive relevant consultation or followup evaluation,12
As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance RBA TSMC sets up its Supplier Code of Conduct according to RBAs Code of Conduct TSMC requires Tier suppliers to comply with the Code of Conduct while encouraging them to ask their upstream,17
Supply Chain Threephase Risk Assessment,17
For the preliminary assessment examine the category and source the origin of all products based on the business relations TSMC has with the suppliers to analyze potential risks,15
Dene the Supplier Risk Matrix and the management measures according to the SAQ results by Suppliers the resilience of Tier the supply chain and the trading amount,17
For critical highrisk suppliers in the Matrix whose management is more urgent TSMC conducts on site audits to identify the actual risk status and provides constant consultation to reduce risks,17
suppliers contractors and service providers to adopt the same Code in practices and management New suppliers must sign the TSMC Supplier Code of Conduct to be eligible for partnership,17
To have an indepth understanding of the current status of supply chain development and potential risks TSMC conducts a threephase risk assessment in supplier management identifying the improvement measures required for the suppliers according to supplier classication,17
First TSMC investigates and analyzes all suppliers,17
Suppliers in Taiwan where TSMC headquarters,17
it has businesses with and requires Tier Suppliers to conduct SelfAssessment Questionnaire SAQ to 2021 evaluate their performance on sustainability In Tier is located completed ve major categories of the TSMC Supplier Code of Conduct are covered The assessment results show that for the Labor category suppliers often lack management rules for the work environment For Health Safety and Environmental Standards of the suppliers did not conduct identication for risks of operations in conned spaces and environmental protection laws For the Code of Business Ethics SAQ results show that of the suppliers do not have a management system for business ethics,17
TSMC categorizes critical suppliers according to indicators such as procurement expenses product criticality and business relations with TSMC and determines the risk levels based on SAQ results and supplier records of priority incidents Using the two dimensions criticality and risk levels TSMC establishes a Supplier Risk Matrix that classies suppliers annually Such classication is then used in determining exclusive management measures to eectively understand the supply chains overall risk TSMC included two new categories in the In SAQ for raw materials suppliers Supply Chain Risk Management and Process Reliability Suppliers that scored below ensure the supply chains resilience,17

Without compromising our excellent product quality we have been discussing projects for simplifying processes and extending the life cycle of chemicals and equipment maintenance to target source reduction To expand the scope of our source reduction measures we are utilizing interorganizational cooperation to treat IPA wastewater so that it can be reused in cooling towers We are also capitalizing on the Smart Copy approach to roll out ways to reuse hydrofluoric acid to new processes in other facilities,15
InterOrganizational Cooperation Leads to a Monthly IPA Wastewater Reduction of 682 Metric Tons,20
Smart Copy across Facilities Leads to a Monthly Hydrouoric Acid Wastewater Reduction of 870 Metric Tons,20
TSMC discovered through the Unit Waste Output Management System that the total amount of B is higher than that of mature processes Upon analysis,19
In IPA wastewater produced at Fab we realized that advanced processes require the use of IPA and deionized water to prevent the structure from collapsing when spindrying wafers which produces a large quantity of relatively lowconcentration IPA wastewater To reduce IPA wastewater euents TSMC launched an interorganizational discussion and experiment involving the Processes Equipment and Facility Division and was able to successfully separate relatively lowconcentration IPA wastewater from existing wastewater systems The separated IPA wastewater is then biodegraded to produce euents that can be reused by cooling towers This has the dual eects of reducing our monthly IPA wastewater reduction by metric tons as well as water conservation and reducing energy consumption by reducing outsourced distillation treatments,20
to increase the yield rate of advanced processes Fab,12
In of back rinsing wafers with hydrouoric acid Originally the hydrouoric acid could only be used once before disposal into the wastewater tank To fulll our commitment to green manufacturing we used the Smart Copy approach to replicate the circulatory mechanism of adding acid from mature processes and was able to successfully develop an automatic concentration adjustment system exclusive to hydrouoric acid We increase the concentration of recycled hydrouoric acid so that it can be reused metric again increasing the number of times that hydrouoric acid can be used thereby reducing tons of hydrouoric acid wastewater monthly,20
