not only gained funding but also received guidance in the gradual,12
adoption of PBL approaches by firstline IT instructors which has,12
been really helpful Foundation offer us opportunities for ongoing,12
studies and provide needed funds for participati in competitions They empathize with our needs,12

Donation of popular science books and book report card activity,12
A total of 1750 copies of 50 carefully selected popular science books published last year were donated to 35,12
selected schools in 2021 These books represent precious reading resources for schools that lack such resources,2
A significant number of schools have set up designated popular science reading areas or book carts,2
organized a book fair to display,12
has set up a mobile book cart,15
open boxes filled with new,19
The book donation was followed by a book report card,12
activity A total of 1365 such cards were received 1201,12

3rd nationwide in Biology numerous students from,8
This marks the tenth year of our intertidal zone themed science,23
project Our experiments have been subsidized by MediaTek for,12
four consecutive years In the biological research process our,2
students have conducted intensive studies of urchins for almost,23
two years which in hindsight is quite extraordinary,12
Technology changes rapidly and children change their preferences more and more frequently The only,22
way to make children focus on the same topic for an extended period is a science project Repeated,2
corroboration of ideas and speculations exposes children to scientific exploration processes They learn,4
how to focus and commit to a certain research object and thereby build up their confidence When I see,3
the confidence and focus in their eyes during the final stage I am absolutely certain that what matters,12
most is not success but rather the transformation of the children,2
This joy and happiness is my greatest motivation for forging ahead,9
Gongliao Elementary School in New Taipei City the school,2
garnered an Honorable Mention Award in its first city,12
The school has never participated in a science fair before Our,2
teachers and students therefore have no practical experience,2
associated with such exhibitions The experiments therefore,12
represented a brandnew experience for everyone and the students,8
displayed great interest in the tests and experiments,12
After passing the preliminary reviews for the New Taipei City Science Fair for elementary and middle,2
schools the students had to introduce their work to the judges on the day of the final reviews,12
which was an invaluable experience for the children Our original intention was simply to give the,2
students a chance to carry out experiments in a meticulous manner We never thought we could pass,2
the preliminary and final reviews or even win an award We are overjoyed to be presented with this,12
Honorable Mention Award This represents a great source of motivation for us and we are deeply,12
grateful to MediaTek Foundation for their support and sponsorship We will continue to embrace a,12
spirit of passion and sincerity in our efforts in the field of science,10
