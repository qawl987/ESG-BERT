CHT Material Climate Risks Opportunities in 2021,13
Increased electricity bill derived from changes to the energy mix in Taiwan,24
Risk Impact Summary In line with the renewable energy development policy in Taiwan an accelerated use of renewable energy in the energy mix and a rising cost in electricity shall be a future trend in Taiwan The Ministry of Economic Affairs estimated that the energy price will rise by 30 by 2025 CHT has a high demand in electricity consumption The operating cost will rise as a result,24
Risk Responses With a high demand in electricity we know for sure an increased electricity bill will pose a significant impact on the operating costs Therefore we attach important to corporate actions for energy saving and energy efficiency improvement Take the IDCs for example the selfdeveloped Intelligent Environment Network iEN Service and the Power Operation Supervisory System POSS for IDCs are used to dynamically manage energy online to achieve the benefits of carbon reduction and environmental protection via technology,24
Increased costs from GHG emissions eg additional costs of carbon fee in line with the regulations,25
Risk Impact Summary Our country has proposed the plan to achieve netzero emissions by 2050 The Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act in force sets a maximum of NT1500 per metric ton of carbon Meanwhile it is planned to enact the carbon fee mechanism the current plan is to levy NT100 per metric ton of carbon on the focused manufacturers If the carbon fee is expanded to Chunghwa Telecom in the future it will increase the operating costs of CHT,25
Risk Responses Pursuant to the IEA recommendations energy efficiency improvement is an effective mean to carbon reduction Thus CHT set the target of netzero emissions by 2050 Aside from active actions for energy saving and energy efficiency improvement it also began to invest in renewable energy,24
As of 2021 CHT reached 4506 kWp of installed solar PV capacity and is planning to procure renewable energy so as to cut its carbon emissions step by step,24
Increased energy consumption due to rising average temperature,24
Risk Impact Summary Based on the Taiwan Climate Change Projection Information and Adaptation Knowledge Platform TCCIP MOST it is estimated that the average temperature in Taiwan will rise by 135C in 20212060,13
According to the Bureau of Energy every 1 C lower for airconditioning comes with an additional 6 energy consumed Since CHT relies on AC system to maintain IDC operation the rising temperature will lead to rising operating costs for CHT as well,24
Risk Responses With the emphasis on energy efficiency apart from the development of the Environment ARtificer Theurgy EARTH system iEN Service and POSS to manage and cut energy consumption the advantage of the fixedline facilities is combined to deploy the 5G construction with the CRAN architecture which is low in failure rate easy for maintenance and more energy efficient,24
Adoption of lowcarbon technologies to raise energy efficiency,24
Opportunity Impact Summary CHT has a high demand in electricity due to its industrial characteristics that 9757 of the total emissions is from Scope 2 If CHT adopts lowcarbon technologies to raise the energy efficiency it may effectively cut the energy demand and carbon emissions of the Company,24
Opportunity Responses By active adoption of lowcarbon technologies for instance we are the first domestic telecom operator to adopt the Centralized RAN CRAN architecture for 5G deployment Through the centralized management we effectively reduce costs and enjoy the benefits of rapid failure response and repairment Also it saves the energy consumption and space for AC installation to individual sites which comes with the benefits of efficiency and energy saving that helps in the performance of carbon reduction,24
Popularization of 5G IoT big data and other emerging technologies to drive industrial transformation,1
Opportunity Impact Summary The International Telecommunication Union ITU pointed out that to achieve the climate goal in the Paris Agreement the ICT sector will have to utilize its technical strengths and capabilities to contribute to the global carbon reduction efforts Take IoT for instance the IoT sector in Taiwan yielded approximately NT176 trillion worth of output value in 2021,13
Opportunity Responses Active investment of resources in innovation and development to drive the lowcarbon transformation in the industry,3
