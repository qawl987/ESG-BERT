The globe is now encouraging businesses to respond to the Sciencebased Targets Initiative SBTi and set up their emission reduction target through scientic methods that can ensure C GIGABTE has not announced our SBT Sciencebased keep the global warming under 2Targets but we did adopt SBTi recommended tools and review standards Existing carbon reduction targets were examined to determine the gap between the SBT approved carbon reduction path The longterm goal was amended in 2020 to Reduce carbon emissions by 50 in 2025 compared to 2009,"21
"
Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Reduction PerformanceGIGABYTE has conducted annual organizational GHG inventory and thirdparty certication since  2010  The  inventory  scope  covers  the  Headquarters  Nanping  Factory  in  Taoyuan as  well  as  Dongguan  Factory  and  Ningbo  Factory  in  China  The  subsidiaries  Bestyield International  and  GStyle  Taipei  Silicon  Valley  offices  added  to  the  scope  of  inventory  in 2021  The  diverse  product  portfolio  of  GIGABYTE  not  only  meant  that  we  catered  to  the needs of the stayathome economy and working from home caused by the pandemic over the  past  two  years  We  also  worked  with  global  partners  to develop  a  variety  of  innovative  solutions  to  bring  smart technology to manufacturing healthcare transportation and  communications  The  resulting  surge  in  demand for  production  output  led  to  a  405  increase  in  our absolute  GHG  emissions  in  2021  compared  to  the previous  year  and  a  reduction  of  3885  compared to  our  baseline  year  However  the  carbon  emission intensity of our revenues dropped by 278 compared to the previous year,"25

Participation in CDPSince 2010 GIGABYTE has responded to the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire because of  customer  requests  Besides  responding  to  customers  requirement  and  international expectations participating in CDP helps further selfexamine the implementing processes of carbon management adjust the carbon management approaches according to the evaluative results and feedback in order to improve the overall management system,"13
"
In 2021 GIGABYTEs CDP rating was A Leadership Our rating was better than the industry average and the regional average for Asia Our supplier engagement rating SER was also AThe growing domestic and overseas importance of carbon management  means that  we will continue to strengthen our carbon reduction initiatives and review the weaknesses in our performance in order to realize the goal of lowcarbon technology,"17

GIGABYTE incorporates lifecycle thinking into product research development and assembly and considers material recycling and environmental friendliness from the design stage The selection  of  raw  materials  strictly  follows  the  hazardous  substances  control  rules  After  the products are sold we provide a longer warranty period and repair services Furthermore the customer service center provides electronic equipment recycling services regardless of brand and  develops  a  circular  business  model  based  on  returned  logistic  services  that  strive  to achieve resource recycling and reduce the overall environmental impacts of products ,"15
"
Moreover disclosing transparent environmental impact data of products is a manufacturers responsibility  to  consumers  GIGABYTE  started  by  establishing  a  product  carbon  footprint calculation system in 2016 and is able to issue product environmental reports that cover 12 aspects of environmental impacts For more information regarding the details of GIGABYTE product environmental reports and its developing processes please visit the GIGABYTE CSR Website,"15
"
Hazardous Substance ManagementTo  GIGABYTE  ensuring  our  products  to  be  safe  for  consumers  and  be  friendly  to  the environment is the basic principle as a manufacturer The trends and changes of international hazardous  substances  management  standards  are  reported  quarterly  at  the  Green Sustainability Committee meetings A crossdepartment response plan will be started timely when  it  is  necessary  The  plan  will  set  the  response  time  target  in  order  to  make  sure  that GIGABYTEs products comply with the latest laws and regulations in time,"19
"
We issue the GIGABYTE Harmful Chemical Substances Requirements HCSR that classies the  substances  into  three  levels  Level  A  prohibited  substances  Level  B  prohibited substances  with  time  limits  and  Level  C  potentially  prohibited  substances  in  the  future Through  systematically  managing  the  list  of  highrisk  substances  and  forming  respective responding plans according to the hazardous levels we could quickly eliminate prohibited substances,"19

Friendly Packaging MaterialsGIGABYTE is continuing to streamline packaging increase the ratio of recycled materials used and replacement of polystyrene padding materials in order to reduce consumption of packaging materials and the waste they subsequently produce We began analyzing our packaging recovery rate and composition in 2011 and reduction progress is reviewed every year In 2021 GIGABYTE launched the Product Packaging and Incoming Packaging Reduction Plan Nonuse of disposable packaging materials from 2030 onwards was set as the ultimate goal,"15
"
To  keep  with  our  mission  of  Love  the  Earth  GIGABYTE  makes  every  effort  to  avoid  excessive packaging  while  maintaining  a  certain  level  of  protection  The  total  weight  of  packaging  used  by products in recent years is declining In 2021 GIGABYTE used 69742 tonnes of paper packaging and  3762  tonnes  of  plastic  packaging  Total  use  of  packaging  was  therefore  4968  lower  than 2011 The 2021 recycling rate dipped slightly compared to the previous year due to the reduction in paper packaging use being more signicant than the amount of plastic packaging used We will continue to implement our goal through the reduction action plan,"15
