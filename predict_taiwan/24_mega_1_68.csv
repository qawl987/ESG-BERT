Based on the historical data of natural disasters in Taiwan Typhoon Disaster is the most common type of disaster in Taiwan and extreme torrential rain is one of the causes of significant disasterrelated damage to the society and economy of Taiwan According to the National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction NCDR flooding and pollution hazards in various township areas of Taiwan are classified into five levels 1low 2moderately low 3moderate 4moderately high 5high using the RCP 26 and RCP 85 Scenario concentration pathway 26 and 85 in the United Nations IPCC AR5 Based on these five levels a scenario analysis of various operations including business services supply chains location of operation etc of Mega Group was performed to evaluate the physical risk of flooding,"5
"
By referring to the useful life in years for fixed assets as announced by the National Taxation Bureaus of the Ministry of Finance Mega ensures that the company measures the possible impact that the physical risks of climate change have on the duration of collateral assets during the collateral credit period,"13
"
The credit duration and the life of the real estate collateral are used for the assessment of physical risks According to the IPCC 5th assessment report RCP 26 and RCP 85 are used as the hypothetical scenarios and the NCDR platform is used to analyze the climate sensitivity from threedimensional level assessment Hazard Vulnerability flooding potential sloping hazards Exposure The following table analyzes the distribution of real estate collateral in each risk level,"13

Transition Risks statistics on exposure to carbonintensive industries,"18
"
The ratio of risk exposure of high carbonemitting industries to the total risk exposure of the Group was statistically analyzed Based on industry classification high carbonemitting industries include extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas cement manufacturing iron and steel refining motor vehicles manufacturing and power distribution The carbon reduction targets of four carbonintensive companies with respect to carbon price and carbon penalties were analyzed using the WB2C scenario to conduct a stress test on carbon prices a selfdefined carbon reduction scenario the NDC and B2DS scenarios etc Currently we analyzed the transition risks specific to industrial customers and suppliers by assessing carbon prices and carbon intensity,"18
"
Climate risk analysis was performed using the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment PACTA tool which was developed by 2 Investing Initiative 2DII Based on the goal of ensuring that financial activities do not cause an increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above preindustrial levels the tool classifies petrochemical cement automotive steel and coal mining industries as climatesensitive sectors and covers CO2 emissions and potential losses under scenario analysis and stress testing Mega took an inventory of the industries to whom the Group has extended credit Considering the contribution of these industries to global carbon emissions we defined the credits extended to climatesensitive industries as carbonrelated assets of the Group thereby ensuring that our credit risk management under a climate change transition scenario is in line with the banks risk management policy The results showed that the credit risks of climatesensitive industries were properly controlled,"13
"
The investment portfolio of Mega covered 93 including cement steel oil and gas of the climatesensitive sectors defined in the PACTA A stress test was conducted using the transition risk that entails policy and legal changes implemented to promote a transition to a lowercarbon economy The results showed that under a climate stress test scenario the transition risk may reduce the financial value of investment portfolios by about 039 For details please refer to the Mega Holdings TCFDBased Report which will be published at the end of 2022,"13
"
Four of the more emissionsintensive companies which are subject to monitoring by the Environmental Protection Administration were selected to conduct a scenario analysis of the transition risks of customers to whom the Group has extended credits The financial impact of different scenarios on the four selected companies was analyzed using carbon price as a factor The results can serve as a reference for the strategic planning and evaluation of future investments and financing The scenarios are described as follows,"18
"
The Nationally Determined Contribution NDC scenario refers to the following Reduce 146 of emissions every year before 2030 and reduce GHG emissions by 50 by 2030 equivalent to an emission level 20 below that of 2005 and reduce emissions to at least 50 of the 2005 emission level by 2050,"25
"
In the B2DS if the world starts reducing carbon emissions every year starting from 2020 netzero emissions will be reached by 2060 to limit future temperature increases to 175C by 2100,"25
"
The SBTi adopts the Absolute Emissions Contraction AEC scenario which assumes a 25 annual reduction,"25
"
1The rate of increase in emissions based on the companys annual carbon emissions is estimated as followsCustomer A power About 2,"25
"
2Based on the rate of increase in the carbon emissions of the aforementioned companies the carbon emissions up to the years 2030 and 2050 are estimated,"25
"
A summary of each companys planned reduction target is provided below,"24
"
Customer A power With 2016 as base year reduce 7 over shortterm to 2021 15 over medium term to 2025 and 20 over longterm to 2030,"3

Customer C steel With 2018 as base year reduce 1 on a yearly basis over shortterm in 1 to 2 years and reduce 7 over mid and longterm 3 years or longer,"18
"
Customer D petrochemical With 2018 as base year reduce 10 by 2025,"24
"
The carbon emissions of each company through to 2030 were estimated using the base scenario and a scenario analysis on each company was performed using the selfdefined carbon reduction NDC and B2DS scenarios Among the for analyzed companies Customer A power sector exhibited the most significant reduction effect mainly due to the continuous increase in carbon emission by Customer A in the future which requires an increase of NT641 billion 659 billion and 908 billion in carbon reduction cost in terms of carbon price and penalties under the selfdefined NDC and B2DS scenarios respectively ,"25

To achieve the UNs SDGs and the Paris Agreement goals the Companys climate risk management mechanism is based on the latest laws and regulations including the international TCFD recommendations Taiwans Green Finance 20 Policy and Climate Change Response Law formerly the GHG Reduction and Management Law the UNs IPCC AR6 SBTi and the national netzero emissions target etc,"25
"
The Companys Board of Directors has approved the Risk Management Policy and Guidelines and other risk management rules for Mega Group These rules stipulate that effective mechanisms for risk identification measurement monitoring and control reporting and response shall be established risk management targets shall be set and a followup of the implementation status shall be regularly conducted The Company has also established management principles for credit risks market risks operational risks legal and compliance risks human resources management risks and information security management risks Each subsidiary has incorporated these principles into its policies and goals of risk management and related internal control regulations to build a complete risk management system for the group,"18
"
In June 2019 Mega has incorporated the management of other new risks in its Risk Management Policy and Guidelines which state that the potential risks of climate change to the companys operations and finance shall be addressed and related risk factors integrated into existing risk management processes For emerging risks we referred to the WEF Global Risk Report classifying potential risks that threaten the world in the future into five categories economic environmental geopolitical societal and technological risks with more than 30 risk factors The subsidiaries are then required to examine the connection of these risks to their business activity compile a summary of emerging risks that are relevant to the subsidiary identify each risk in terms of probability of occurrence and degree of impact and eventually assess and select the emerging risks that are most relevant to Mega Group ,"13
"
To oversee the effectiveness of the risk management mechanisms of Mega Financial Holding and its subsidiaries climate risk scenario analysis or stress testing may be internally introduced in stages and adapted to the characteristic of the internal operation With consideration to the impact of climate change an appropriate risk scenario is selected and a qualitative or quantitative approach is employed to assess whether a strategy eg business management products and services is able to respond to climate risks and opportunities The Board of Directors should recognize the risks associated with a business operation and monitor the results of such operation and bears the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that an appropriate and effective internal control system is established and maintained ,"13
"
In addition Mega Financial Holding and major subsidiaries have all established a risk management unit Mega Financial Holding communicates policies to all subsidiaries through the risk management unit which then serve as the basis for each subsidiary to establish risk management goals monitoring indicators risk limits and implementation guidelines based on the nature of their business These are then submitted to business units for adoption The risk management unit reviews business and assetliability risks and regularly reports the status of risk management to the Risk Management Committee and Board of Directors,"18

Under its existing business and risk management systems Mega adopts countermeasures when overall operation is exposed to climaterelated risks These measures include but are not limited to the following,"13
"
Risky businesses characterized by high loss probability and severity are avoided,"18
"
Businesses characterized by low loss probability but high loss severity are minimized or transferred These include purchasing insurance submission of collateral or guarantor syndicated loans selling of secondary market debt securities or derivative financial products for credit undertakings etc,"18
"
A list of investments in energyintensive and highly sensitive companies is controlled and assessed to avoid excess spread of exposure to highrisk customers,"18
"
The ESG effect or impact of a borrower and hisher use of loan should be determined when processing loans The results will serve as a factor of consideration and provide a basis for risk mitigation ESG impact plans are included in loan terms or commitment to reduce the banks ESG risks,"18
"
Yearly reviews are performed to examine whether the climate risks of loan borrowers generated a financial impact to a degree that affects their solvency Carbonintensive companies under governmental supervision are encouraged to disclose the improvement status of their transition risks to secure a special rate,"18
"
Cases involving a high level of pollution high carbon emissions and significant environmental violation are carefully assessed Companies announced or sanctioned by authorities in Taiwan or overseas should submit a concrete improvement plan Business dealings with them may be carried out only after prudent assessments If such dealings already exist the customer should be urged to make improvement denied an incremental loan or hisher loans gradually recovered,"25
"
With the declining environmental conditions around the world Mega Holdings realized that climaterelated risks and opportunities will eventually generate an impact on the Groups operations For this reason we considered the impact of climaterelated risks and opportunities when setting our annual business goals and business strategies The business and response measures covered in our climate strategy are as follows,"13
"
Loan applications with real estate provided as collateral are evaluated to mitigate the risk of extreme weather events which may incur loss of collateral value to the company or to encourage the customer to purchase insurance to pass through costs or cover losses Insurance purchase applications are evaluated to mitigate the risk of extreme weather events which may cause the company to lose a significant amount of claims or underestimate the insurance premium or to adopt insurance to pass through costs or cover losses,"13
"
