About AEPAmerican Electric Power based in Columbus Ohio is powering a cleaner brighter energy future for its customers and communities AEPs approximately 16700 employees operate and maintain the nations largest electricity transmission system and more than 224000 miles of distribution lines to safely deliver reliable and affordable power to 55 million regulated customers in 11 states AEP also is one of the nations largest electricity producers with approximately 31000 megawatts of diverse generating capacity including more than 7100 megawatts of renewable energy The companys plans include growing its renewable generation portfolio to approximately 50 of total capacity by 2030 AEP is on track to reach an 80 reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 2000 levels by 2030 and has committed to achieving netzero by 2050 AEP is recognized consistently for its focus on sustainability community engagement and diversity equity and inclusion AEPs family of companies includes utilities AEP Ohio AEP Texas Appalachian Power in Virginia and West Virginia AEP Appalachian Power in Tennessee Indiana Michigan Power Kentucky Power Public Service Company of Oklahoma and Southwestern Electric Power Company in Arkansas Louisiana east Texas and the Texas Panhandle AEP also owns AEP Energy which provides innovative competitive energy solutions nationwide For more information visit aepcom,24
Strong financial and operational performance is inextricably linked to robust environmental social and governance ESG practices and strategy Awareness of how ESG impacts the full value chain helps to inform business decisions while delivering results Whether aligning our capital investments with our decarbonization and grid modernization strategy or our commitment to a strong safety culture and governance practices AEPs efforts to integrate ESG into the business deliver short and longterm value for all stakeholders,3
In 2021 we set new carbon reduction goals our goal is to reduce AEPs carbon emissions from directly owned generation scope 1 80 by 2030 compared to 2000 levels and to achieve netzero emissions by 2050 scopes 1 and 2 The climate scenarios we conducted showed that we can reach more than 95 toward zero by 2050 with conventional technologies and we remain hopeful that emerging technologies such as advanced nuclear carbon capture hydrogen and energy storage will help us close that gap Through the end of 2021 AEP has reduced its carbon emissions 70 from 2000 levels We are committed to periodically reviewing these goals as we work toward a clean energy future,25
In total from 2011 to 2021 AEP has retired or sold more than 13700 MW of coalfueled generation and we have plans to retire another 5300 MW between 2022 and 2028 That will leave five remaining coal plants on our system totaling 6500 MW The timing for full retirement of coalfueled generation assets will be based on a combination of factors including expected investments for operations overall economics useful asset life and depreciation rates and reliability factors highlighted in our integrated resource plans In addition we rely on our partnerships with our state regulators and local communities to assess the economics timing and impacts,12
AEPs goals and our strategy for transitioning are driven by our integrated resource plans which are overseen by state regulators,12
Increasingly we have seen renewables become more cost competitive enabling AEP to invest in economical clean energy resources that also reduce our carbon footprint In addition many of our customers want clean energy for their homes and businesses Our strategy is to meet that demand where regulators support it,24
2021 marked an important milestone in AEPs clean energy transition when the company announced a plan to shift our generation portfolio from majority fossil fuel to majority renewables by the end of this decade The strategy proposes adding approximately 16 gigawatts of new regulated renewable resources by 2030 This includes the 1484 MW North Central Energy Facilities which were completed in March 2022 and are now delivering lowercost clean energy to our customers in Oklahoma Louisiana and Arkansas,24
Our capital investment strategy is critical in supporting our decarbonization and renewable energy strategy From 2022 through 2026 AEP plans to invest 38 billion in capital with an emphasis on transmission distribution and regulated renewable energy with the ability to shift capital as needed This includes investing 82 billion in regulated renewable generation Additionally we eliminated growth,12
capital in the Generation Marketing segment as we have begun the process to sell some or all of our unregulated renewable assets This will provide additional capital to invest in our core regulated businesses to support rebuilding and reinforcing the grid and enhancing service for customers,4
Having a modern reliable resilient and secure grid is vital to our clean energy transformation Investing in the grid enables AEPs decarbonization strategy as we prepare to accommodate new cleaner,3

More often than not the transition to a clean energy economy focuses on carbon emissions reductions as the leading indicator of success in slowing the effects of climate change But climate change is as much a structural change to our economy as it is an environmental issue As we transition to cleaner forms of energy there are impacts to people communities and society at large that must be considered and thoughtfully managed The lowcarbon transition is a doubleedge sword with lasting socioeconomic effects especially for communities dependent on the fossil fuel industry for jobs taxes and corporate philanthropic support At AEP we are establishing a new model for enabling a Just Transition that is collaborative inclusive and communitydriven,13

As one of the largest electric utilities in the US we have a responsibility to keep our customers lights on 247 The nations power grid is subject to an array of threats including extreme weather vandalism terrorism cyberattacks and insider risks all of which have the potential to jeopardize reliability safety and data security The growing reality of cyber and physical threats to our industrys infrastructure requires companies to implement leading security practices policies and oversight to prevent protect against or reduce the impacts of cyber and physical attacks The need to protect the power grid from these threats is especially heightened in light of current geopolitical events,1
AEP continually evaluates cyber and physical security risks enterprisewide using our comprehensive security strategy known as Defense in Depth Using a risk management approach this strategy assumes a broad range of threat possibilities such as physical theft unauthorized access to data thirdparty risk and incidental threats that do not specifically target protected systems or assets Leveraging a more comprehensive approach to understanding and managing these risks in relation to other enterprise risks enables us to make decisions based on the level of acceptable risk while informing our priorities and resource needs,1
Strong governance oversight and regulations are vital to the strength and resilience of our bulk electric system BES The cyber and physical security of the BES is highly regulated by the federal government through North American Electric Reliability Corporations NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection CIP Standards In addition to regulatory oversight AEP has a multilevel governance structure that focuses on managing security risk across the entire system In 2021 AEPs Board of Directors formed a Technology Committee that provides review and oversight of issues related to setting information technology IT and cybersecurity strategy,1
