connectors have been at the forefront of EV charging technology for over a decadedelivering fully proven and innovative connectors solutions across the globe Cannon connectors support EV infrastructure expansion for,24
Energy efficiency is the first step to minimizing environmental impacts,24
while ensuring our production is economical and competitive ITT has,4
implemented projects across many of our global locations to reduce,2
energy usage by improving lighting and climate control systems and,24
For example our facility in Termoli Italy recently upgraded its,12
compressor system and as a result saved 1650 MWh of electricity and 356400 kg CO2eq which is almost equal to the amount of energy 200 homes would use in one year By upgrading its compressor,24
systems our Termoli plant is saving approximately 30 of electricity,24
Another example of energy efficiency improvements that we are,24
making relates to the two cogeneration units that we are investing in at Barge Italy and Kanczuga Poland These gas powered cogeneration,24
plants will use the latest gas turbine technology to produce electricity,24
and supply the sites needs in terms of cooling and heating All this while,24
reducing our energy consumption and emissions by approximately,24
ITT maintains stateoftheart controls to reduce GHG emissions and,25
volatile organic compounds VOCs other hazardous air pollutants and,21
particulate matter Our emissions controls include carbon filters and,21
regenerative thermal oxidizers RTOs plus monitoring programs to,24
Over the last few years ITT has significantly built upon its commitment to renewable energy including increasing our capacity for energy generation In addition to building our clean energy,24
production capability we also invest in purchasing renewable energy,24
Carbon offsets are a practical and effective way to address climate,13
change counteract our carbon footprint and encourage the growth of,13
renewable energy However our focus continues to be on reducing and,24
avoiding emissions As we define our path to carbon neutrality we will,25
Guarantees of origin GOs are a marketbased instrument that,4
certifies the bearer owns one megawatthour MWh of electricity,24
Since 2020 ITT has purchased Guarantees of Origin for electricity,12
from the local grid for the Barge Termoli and Vauda Italy production,24
plants as well as for our Kanczuga Poland site In 2021 we extended,15
renewable energy certificates to our facilities in Stalowa Wola Poland,24
Including the benefit of the Guarantees of Origin ITT has reduced our net GHG emissions by more than 21640000 kg CO2eq in 2021 roughly the emissions produced by 3300 gas,25
Over the past several years we have made significant investments in technology resources and equipment,24
to reduce our carbon footprint These investments and the Guarantees of Origin have resulted in a net,12
reduction of our GHG emissions by 32 versus 2019 despite a significant increase in volume Building on,25
these improvements in 2022 ITT began to develop its path to carbon neutrality that will guide the companys,12
environmental practices over the next several decades through the ReduceAvoidOffset framework We,18
launched the first phase of this initiative in 2022,12
Friction Italy Pilot Program AtAGlance Anticipating more stringent regulatory requirements related to GHG emissions in 2022 we initiated a pilot,25
program at our Motion Technologies sites in ItalyBarge Vauda Canavese and Termoligeared towards,12
precisely quantifying and analyzing Scope 1 2 and 3 GHG emissions on a path to carbon neutrality We chose to,25
As a result of this initiative we have improved,12
the integrity of our data that led to adjustment,0
2019 which we believe will allow us to more,12
begin this process in Italy because these are the most energy intensive sites across ITT as well as the most,24
Chart represents percent of total ITT energy usage in 2021 by site,24
advanced facilities in their sustainability journey In fact Motion Technologies accounts for nearly 70 of ITTs,15
total emissions in 2021 and the three sites account for 34,25
The primary objectives of the pilot program are as follows,2
1 Development of locationbased GHG calculations that provide a complementary view to our marketbased,25
2 Introduction and deployment of a detailed action list of green capex projects to reduce and eliminate,12
3 Development of best practices and lessons learned that can be applied to future projects,12
4 Introduction of emissions reduction targets for all of ITT based on the pilot findings extrapolated across,25
Our work over the past several years has set the foundation for the,10
emissions reduction targets we are establishing today We expect to,25
reduce our global Scope 1 and 2 emissions for all of ITT by 10 by,25
We believe these targets are meaningful and achievable and a first step in defining and developing a path to,12
carbon neutrality We will use the methodology that has been successfully deployed in the pilot to asses our,25
efforts determine how we can deploy similar strategies to other locations throughout Europe and North America,3
and to further develop near mid and longterm targets that are sciencebased and supported by data We,12
will continue to determine the timing and cadence of our effort based on the energy usage energy security and,24
Working with subject matter experts on the ground and local consultants the team is developing tools to,12
energy cost at each site We will update our Board and other stakeholders at least annually on our progress and,24
track and analyze the efficacy of emissions reduction projects We are incorporating analytics to measure,21
we expect that future actions will include identification and analysis of scope 3 emissions as well,25
our progress and leveraging best practices as we plan for the next phase of the rollout As an example we,3
have developed an Energy Assessment matrix by plant that structures our approach to energy sustainability,24
Throughout 2021 we continued to produce environmentally friendly technologies for our customers while making,15
investments to reduce our own carbon footprint We understand that commitments to move towards a more,25
sustainable future also require a change in how we allocate capital,3
Beginning in 2021 ITT committed to allocate up to 10,12
of our annual capital expenditures towards initiatives to,12
In our Barge Italy facility we invested in a cogeneration,12

Nogales MexicoWe are investing approximately 1 million to install 1050 solar panels over the employee parking lot at our Nogales Mexico facility This installation will reduce CO2 emissions by 404 tonnes annually and will support 8 of our energy needs at the site The carbon offset is equivalent to planting more than 6500 treesBarge ItalyToday our facility in Barge boasts two photovoltaic systems which are described below and we recently approved the construction of a third system As a result of these investments in 2023 the total installed capacity of our photovoltaic systems will be 1065 kWp which will reduce the sites dependence on external energy supply by 9The Solar Lake We invested 25 million to construct a solar lake that consists of approximately 3000 solar panelsabout the size of four Olympicsized swimming pools The installation will support approximately 30 of energy demand at the innovation center The lake is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by 3728 tonnes per year equivalent to the CO2 emissions generated by about 42000 gallons of gas The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2022The Production Plant Rooftop We are investing approximately 16 million to install about 2000 solar panels to cover the rooftop of our Motion Technologies production plant The installation will reduce CO2 emissions by 284 tonnes annually and will support approximately 2 of the production plants energy needs This carbon reduction is equivalent to planting approximately 5000 treesOudBeijerland NetherlandsWe are investing approximately 16 million for solar panels at our KONI facility in OudBeijerland Netherlands This project will consist of approximately 4250 solar panels installed on the facility roof This installation will generate 1600 kwh of electricity and support 55 of the sites energy needs This will reduce CO2 emissions by 460 tonnes annually equivalent to planting more than,21
ITT uses both direct energy sources eg natural gas and indirect sources eg purchased electricity,24
Natural gas is the largest portion of our direct energy usage Our indirect energy sources include,24
Thanks to increased utilization of renewable energy sources and the environmental benefits of,24
Guarantees of Origin in 2021 total GHG emissions decreased 32 versus 2019 despite increased,25
industrial activity corresponding with a recovery to prepandemic production volumes,24
As part of the Barge Italy pilot program mentioned earlier we increased the scope and rigor in the,12
collection of indirect emissions to include imported thermal and cooling energy which we captured in,24
previous years Our enhanced procedures provided a more accurate representation of our GHG emissions,25
from 2019 which we used as the basis for our 2026 targets We believe that the data and analysis in the,12
2022 pilot will provide a better foundation upon which we will continually measure our progress The Adjustments to each year are reflected in the table to the right,12
Limiting the use of materials in our processes minimizes hazardous and nonhazardous waste and,19
also reduces costs After a 23 reduction in 2020 waste to landfill disposal increased in 2021 due,19
primarily to the significant increase in production volumes coinciding with the emergence from the global pandemic However the waste to landfill disposal was still 13 lower than 2019 prior to the pandemic,19
Waste to Landfill Metric tons of landfill waste,19
ITT uses water for potable supply cleaning activities limited process operations and some cooling and,20
testing applications Our sites employ a variety of methods to reduce water consumption including,20
Our controls plant invested in a closedloop system with water cooling capabilities for endurance testing of,20
recycling and reusing water installing innovative water treatment technology and updating water,20
various Enidine products including elastomeric bearings used in helicopter rotors The testing requires water,20
Our water consumption increased in 2021 due to,20
flushing of fire suppression systems at our Seneca,5
Falls site a onetime leak in underground piping at,5
our Termoli Italy facility and other increases across,12
Our valves plant installed a closed loop water filtration,20
system which reduces water usage by 61 and saves,20
800000 gallons of water annually Thats the equivalent,20
to almost seven years of water consumption for a,20
family of four in the US It also eliminates wastewater,20
within a certain temperature range and the cooling system enables us to reuse the water for subsequent,24
phases of testing We anticipate that installing this new closedloop system will eliminate the use and,15
discharge of an estimated 75 million gallons of water per year,20
ITTs commitment to operational excellence demands we maintain strict quality management programs to,12
meet both our customer and regulatory requirements Around the world our manufacturing facilities comply with,12
a wide range of externally audited standards demonstrated in the table below,0
ISO 9001 International standard for generic quality management system ISO 14001 International standard for environmental management ISO 45001 International standard for occupational health and safety management,9
