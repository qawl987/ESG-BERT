Risk management IBMs consistent systemic and integrated approach to enterprise risk management ERM is designed to identify mitigate and manage significant risks Our ERM function assesses risks across the organization to develop a holistic enterpriselevel view of risks arising from evolving regulatory or financial environments operations or strategic planning and executionincluding environmental and climaterelated risks The program also assesses interdependencies between risks and collaborates with risk owners to optimize actions across IBM,18
We also promote a company culture of risk awareness through online education and mandatory training in areas such as business integrity and cybersecurityincluding a new Risk Academy where IBMers can take courses and earn badges on risk management awareness and skills Additionally IBMers can report potential risks through numerous online channels anonymously if preferred or to local management,1
Oversight of risk management begins with IBMs Board of Directors which is responsible for assessing our ERM approach and overseeing managements execution of its risk responsibilities The board and its three committees receive periodic updates on the ERM program and each committee examines specific risk components,18

Business ethics IBMs legacy of ethics and responsible business practices continues today in how we govern our operations and conduct relationships,0
Environmental and climaterelated risks Climate change is a serious concern that warrants meaningful action on a global basis IBM considers risks as identified by the TCFD in its risk management process IBM like other companies is subject to potential climaterelated risks and costs such as those resulting from increased severe weather events prolonged changes in temperature new regulations affecting hardware products and data centers carbon taxes and increased environmental disclosures requested or required by clients regulators and others,13
IBM senior management assesses the significance of environmental and climaterelated risks and opportunities and manages them accordingly Senior management regularly reports to the Directors and Corporate Governance Committee of the IBM Board of Directors on IBMs environmental programs challenges and emerging issues,13
IBM does not expect climate change or compliance with environmental laws and regulations focused on climate change to have a disproportionate effect on the company or its financial position results of operations and competitive position Conversely we believe that there is opportunity to use IBMs AI hybrid cloud and other technologies to assist clients with managing their climaterelated risks and we continue to invest in solutions such as the IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite and our recent acquisition of Envizi to enhance IBMs capabilities in this area,13
Every year employees worldwide participate in IBMs Business Conduct Guidelines BCGs program to certify their understanding of IBMs code of business conduct and ethics and recommit to doing business with integrity The IBM BCGs policy is available in 26 languages and the accompanying online course which includes ethical dilemmas that employees may face day to day is available in 20 languages In 2021 IBM again achieved 100 participation in the annual BCGs program,0

IBMs internal reporting channel which was refreshed in 2021 to improve the user experience enables employees to report concerns or suspected violations of our BCGs as well as unethical or unlawful behavior within IBM We also have similar reporting channels for suppliers business partners and others to raise concerns Learning about issues and concerns allows IBM to intervene early investigate and remediate,0
Our annual Global Integrity Survey first launched in 2010 enables IBMers to provide feedback on their perception of ethics and integrity within IBM The insights gained from the surveys help us gauge employee sentiment regarding speaking up retaliation and doing the right thing We also use the results to develop action plans to enhance training on targeted topics In 2021 we conducted benchmarking to refresh our questions which we anticipate will yield even better insights,0
Our education initiatives go beyond IBMers as we expect our business partners and suppliers to meet our ethics and integrity standards In 2021 IBM provided online and inperson education to over 34000 representatives of partners and suppliers worldwide,0
Additionally IBM is a member of the Data Trust Alliance established in 2020 to develop and adopt responsible data and AI practices IBM helped lead the development of a set of criteria for organizations to measure against in order to help mitigate against algorithmic bias and promote transparency and explainability when adopting AI to be used in human resources and workforce decisions Other large employers have since endorsed this set of criteria,0
IBM was one of two original signatories to the Vaticans Rome Call for AI Ethics in 2020 intended to promote cooperation in creating a future in which digital innovation and technological progress grant mankind its centrality IBM will join other organizations in renewing our commitment to these principles in 2022,3
Emerging neurotechnologies already offer impressive benefits in areas such as healthcare but this potential comes with questions about risks to privacy and consumer welfare In 2021 the IBM Policy Lab and the Future of Privacy Forum jointly published Privacy and the Connected Minda set of recommendations for promoting privacy and mitigating risks relating to braincomputer interfaces which can record process analyze or modify brain activity invasively or noninvasively IBM believes that policymakers researchers and other stakeholders should proactively seek to understand these risks and develop precise technological and policy safeguards,1
Technology ethics As a company with a long history of pioneering new technologies responsibly IBM is working to advance transformative innovations such as AI into business government medicine and everyday life with a strong commitment to ethics We advocate the IBM Principles for Trust and Transparency and work to embed ethical principles into our AI applications and processes,0
IBM continues to demonstrate leadership in AI Ethics building on the portfolio of AI toolkits for trustworthy AI that weve contributed to the open source community AI FactSheets 360 and Uncertainty Quantification 360 allow other organizations to use and contribute to our experience and knowledge in the creation of AI solutions In 2022 IBM will include technology ethics in the training provided to our ecosystem partners with a goal of 1000 partners participating by yearend,0
The World Economic Forum and the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University recognized IBM as an AI ethics leader in 2021 with their publication of Responsible Use of Technology The IBM Case Study The white paper showcases IBMs Trustworthy AI approach and best practices recognizing many years of work that began in IBM Research and expanded across the IBM portfolio and beyond to external partnerships worldwide,0

IBMs Enterprise and Technology Security group works across the company to protect against cybersecurity risks Within that group IBMs chief information security officer CISO leads a team responsible for information security strategy policies standards architecture and processes IBM maintains extensive internal corporate directives requiring information security activities including the creation and implementation of standards processes and procedures The IBM CISO reviews and approves these directives and other corporate policies annually while the IBM Board of Directors and its Audit Committee also receive regular updates from IBMs security management and other cybersecurity experts,1
Our enterprise IT security policy and related standards are based on industry best practices including but not limited to the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST and the International Organization for Standardization ISO To maintain leadingedge security we have implemented a set of practices called IBM Security and Privacy by Design that all IBM business units use to assess threats test protections and verify that security requirements are met IBM Data Security and Privacy Principles DSP details the contractual commitments of security and data protection IBM makes to its clients IBM has modeled the DSP to be an industryleading collection of security terms that take into account industry standards IBM standard practices and regulatory requirements to craft a comprehensive set of security and privacy commitments to all our clients,1
To validate IBMs security controls we ensure that they are tested and certified regularly through a combination of frameworks and assessment activities including ISO System and Organization Controls SOC the SarbanesOxley Act the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA and others IBM also undergoes numerous internal and external audits and each services team conducts ongoing selfassessments You can learn more about IBMs internal IT security principles at the IBM Trust Center,1
Data privacy IBM believes that consumers deserve strong privacy protections consistent across jurisdictions and that businesses should build trust by providing those protections IBM also advocates for policymakers to focus on constancy and compatibility when crafting new regulations to facilitate a consistent approach to handling personal information while enabling the free and secure flow of data across regions,22
Improving transparency and the user experience continued to be priorities for IBM in 2021 culminating in November with the publication of a new simplified IBM Privacy Statement The IBM Privacy Portal was also enhanced so that users can see the status of their data subject requests and manage their companys information more easily,22
IBM published a case study in 2021 detailing how our threeyear effort to prepare for implementation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation GDPR led IBM to develop our Unified Privacy Framework By embedding governance and privacy controls directly into systems and business processes this framework enables a more proactive approach to compliance governance and reduces the time and effort required to comply with new regulationsfor IBM as well as our clients Learn more about this continuous compliance approach at the IBM Policy Lab,1
All IBMers contractors and employees of IBM subsidiaries receive annual data privacy training In 2021 we redesigned our annual data privacy education program and deployed a new adaptive learning platform that provides more targeted rolebased education based on realworld examples,1
Policy advocacy IBMs public policy advocacy spans a range of issues relevant to our business and stakeholders We engage leaders worldwide to promote ideas that can help spur growth and innovation with new technologies or address societal challenges such as building a skilled and diverse workforce We do this by developing innovative policy ideas that are aligned with national agendas through building trusted relationships with policymakers and through partnerships with academia and civil society IBM has never made political contributions nor endorsed candidates for office and our company does not have a political action committee Following are highlights of our policy advocacy in 2021,12
IBM is advocating for a reinvigorated approach to science,3
and innovation in the US and globally Our Science Forward platform includes increased support for quantum computing technology and research increased investment in semiconductor innovation and creating a Science Readiness Reserves to mobilize in times of crisis You can find more detail on these proposals in IBM CEO Arvind Krishnas letter on the IBM Policy website,3
In May 2021 the IBM Policy Lab published a set of policy,12
recommendations on mitigating bias in artificial intelligence where we called on governments to implement five policy priorities to strengthen adoption of testing assessment and mitigation strategies to minimize instances of bias in AI systems In September IBM responded to the EU proposal for a regulation on artificial intelligence welcoming its approach to regulating specific uses of AI rather than the technology itself We also published detailed views on how the regulation might be clarified to better target the new rules to areas of greatest risk,12
IBM also continues to support programs and policies that,12
can help people qualify for skilled jobs without a traditional bachelors degree In the United States for example we advocate for expanded registered apprenticeship programs education that is better aligned to industry skills needs and a skillsfirst approach to hiring We also believe the Higher Education Act should be modernized to increase flexibility and access to federal student aid programs,2
IBM is committed to meaningful management and oversight and accurate reporting with respect to our public policy engagement including with respect to trade associations We receive consistently high ratings from independent analysts of corporate practices on lobbying and political spending including the Center for Political Accountability and Transparency International UK More information about our public policy governance and public reporting is available on our Philosophy and Governance webpage,12

Diversity and inclusion Through our diversity equity and inclusion journey at IBM our goal is to provide a culture of inclusion and belonging for all IBMers The purpose is to establish trust among IBMers by creating a more diverse workforce cultivating a flexible work environment enabling an inclusive culture and advocating for equity both inside and outside IBM We foster a culture of conscious inclusion and active allyship where every IBMer can make a positive impact on society while bringing their authentic selves to work,8
As we navigated through the second year of the pandemic in 2021 we focused on helping IBMers become better stronger adaptable and more resilient We created an environment to meet employees where they were including their needs on flexibility hybrid work schedule options additional time off and enhanced benefits through mental health support and Employee Assistance Program offerings,9
Our four strategic priorities include accountability advocacy allyship and employee experience which measure our progress through actions and outcomes We believe that transparency accountability action and progress garner trust,0
Accountability Accountability for our leaders encompasses achieving goals owning actions and communicating progress to our employees Our commitment outlined in IBMs 2022 Proxy Statement is to measure our executives globally in their annual incentive program with a modifier for diversity results,8
The diversity modifier is based on improvement in executive representation for women globally and US underrepresented minority URM groups specifically Black and Hispanic executives in the US Our goal remains to improve and close the gap in representation in these key areas,8
We set goals across our business segments globally and met the diversity modifier in 2021 with an improvement in the executive representation of women globally and Black and Hispanic executives in the United States by 10 point 15 points and 04 points respectively,8
Our threeyear trend shows an increase year over year in women globally and most US minority group representation and hiring across four categories overall representation management executive and technical see pages 2728 for more detail Further we committed to disclose our US EEO1 data in 2022 you will find the unofficial submission as of December 31 2021 on page 28,8

IBM launched as the RaleighDurham market leader for OneTen in June 2021 and has since partnered with OneTen leadership to develop its talent development transformation and platform strategies The IBM team designed and hosted monthly Skills First Working Group webinars and office hours managing the security and development of the talent platform The latter represents a 13 million gift to OneTen and our collective vision,8
Allyship Allyship means creating a psychologically safe and supportive workplace where IBMers can be their authentic selves It requires a culture that fosters a sense of inclusion and belonging for everyone Allyship includes the intentional action of others so every voice is respected and heard Current workforce and social trends point to significant societal challenges and experiences like MeToo PressForProgress BlackLivesMatter TimesUp NoBanNoWall StopAsianHate WontBeErased and SayHerName We are experiencing a time of unprecedented need for allyship which includes compassion kindness justice dignity unity and empathy Allyship at IBM is commitment to action,8
Fostering employeecentered allyship behaviors begins by cocreating learning experiences around topics not previously discussed in the workplace such as systemic racism implicit bias being an upstander and covering We have established an allyship intranet site where IBMers can promote their commitment to allyship practice allyship behaviors volunteer to engage and mentor new allies or share their stories about brave allyship,0
We proudly recognize IBM Be Equal Allies who embody intentional and positive everyday efforts to advance and benefit people different from themselves And finally because allyship is an evolution the Be Equal allyship portal shares resources so IBMers can engage in conversations about current events lead through crises and practice inclusive language through our Inclusive Language Guide,8
In July 2021 we dedicated the month to our inclusive learning bundle The course highlighted building an inclusive culture learning plan for all employees and learning specific to managers about diversity and inclusion concepts on identity bias race and inclusive behaviors A threehour facilitated workshop for managers focuses on building action plans leaders can take to build more inclusive behaviors and teams In 2022 trainings include new offerings for sponsorship and intersectionality along with learning modules on inclusive behaviors,8
Employee experience IBMs purpose is underpinned by a corporate culture driven to achieve growth for our clients our company and ourselves The employee experience at IBM is about empowering every IBMer to exemplify the behaviors that foster a culture of conscious inclusion where innovation can thrive and individuals progress,8
We are dedicated to promoting advancing and celebrating plurality of thought from all backgrounds In 2021 we had over 40 events to embrace how we are different and to find areas where we share commonality,8
Recent external ratings also illustrate the impact of our focus on employee experience For example our Glassdoor employee rating increased to 41 and our Comparably rating for best company culture was 47 on a scale of 15a 6point increase from 2019 resulting in 814 of IBMers saying they would recommend IBM as a great place to work,8

Energy and climate change IBM has been demonstrably committed to addressing climate change for three decades As a founding partner IBM helped the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA launch ENERGY STAR in 1992 We began disclosing CO2 emissions in 1994 and made our first purchase of renewable electricity in 2001 IBM published its policy position on climate change in 2007 long before todays acute focus recognizing that climate change is a serious concern that warrants timely meaningful action on a global basis,13
In 2015 IBM voiced its support for the Paris Agreement and reaffirmed such support in 2017 IBM became a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council in 2019 and continues to support the councils bipartisan plan for a carbon tax with its proceedsa carbon dividendto be returned to citizens,12
Updated goals In 2021 IBM established its third consecutive goal for the use of renewable electricity its fifth consecutive goal to reduce greenhouse gas GHG emissions a goal to achieve netzero GHG emissions and related goals for energy conservation data center energy efficiency energyefficient product design suppliers and client engagements Nine of our goals involve climate change Five are described below and the others are cited in this reports sections regarding product energy efficiency and supplier environmental goals,25
Procure 75 of the electricity IBM consumes worldwide from renewable sources by 2025 and 90 by 2030 Reduce IBMs GHG emissions 65 by 2025 against base year 2010 adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures Reach netzero GHG emissions by 2030 using feasible,25
technologies to remove emissions in an amount which equals or exceeds IBMs residual emissions Aim for residual emissions of 350000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent or less by 2030,25
With reference to the voluntary Greenhouse Gas Protocol this addresses Scope 1 Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions associated with electricity consumption at thirdparty colocation data centers,25
IBM has also committed to initiating 100 client,3
engagements or research projects by 2025 in which IBM solutions have enabled demonstrable environmental benefits For example IBM Research is supporting the development of new carbonremoval solutions by accelerating the discovery of enabling materials Implement a minimum of 3000 new energy conservation projects to avoid the consumption of 275000 megawatt hours MWh of energy from 2021 to 2025,24
Improve average data center cooling efficiency 20 by 2025,24
IBMs new 2025 GHG emissions reduction goal achieves a rate of reduction that exceeds what scientists from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC indicate is necessary to limit Earths warming to 15 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels,25
Our energy and emissions goals and reporting cover all activities taking place in IBMowned or leased facilities inclusive of Red Hat These facilities also include IBM data centers located in facilities managed by third parties where IBM does not procure the energy or control the operations of the buildingsalso known as colocation data centers,24
Energy conservation Continuing IBMs five decades of commitment we implemented 936 energy conservation projects in 2021 across more than 190 locations globally avoiding 90000 MWh of energy consumption and 26500 metric tons MT of CO2 emissions and saving 99 million1,24
We adjusted schedules for lighting levels temperature and other building systems to avoid unnecessary consumption of energy during the COVID19 pandemic when buildings were underutilized We also implemented projects in our data centers to improve the energy efficiency of both cooling and IT equipment retrofitted lighting and improved the operational efficiency of our building infrastructure,24
1 In measuring performance against IBMs energy conservation goal we only include the first years savings from projects Accordingly IBMs total energy savings and CO2 emissions avoidance from these projects are greater than this simple summation of the annual results We do not include reductions in energy consumption resulting from downsizings the sale of operations or costavoidance actions such as fuel switching and offpeak load shifting in our energy conservation results,24
IBM will publish yearend 2021 progress against its new renewable electricity and GHG emissions reduction goals in June 2022 once we have completed our annual external limited assurance audit of our GHG emissions calculation process and underlying data,25

Note Energy and emissions goals and reporting cover all activities taking place in IBMowned or leased facilities inclusive of Red Hat These facilities include colocation data centers Renewable electricity procurement includes contracted purchases and renewable electricity that automatically comes to IBM via routine grid power CO2 emissions reduction data is adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures,21
IBM will publish its 2021 energy and climate change data in June 2022 after we have completed an external limited assurance audit of our GHG emissions process and underlying data,25
We have deployed IBMs Internet of Things IoT and analytics solution at 25 major IBM campuses covering 190 buildings and encompassing 41 of IBMs global energy consumption During 2021 this program helped identify energy conservation opportunities that resulted in the avoidance of 3400 MWh of energy and 356000 in expense,24
From 1990 through 2021 IBM conserved 99 million MWh of energyequivalent to more than double IBMs current annual energy consumptionsaving 670 million and avoiding 46 million MT of CO2 emissions,24
Data center energy efficiency We take a holistic approach to managing and improving the energy efficiency of our data centersfrom improving existing space to derive more workload per area to modernizing our IT infrastructure and reducing its energy consumption to building or leasing new higherefficiency space,24
IBM calculates the power usage effectiveness PUE1 at many of the data centers we manage and obtains PUE data from landlords of colocation data centers For the limited number of data centers where we are unable to obtain PUE data we use industry average data Using this approach we calculated our 2021 weighted average PUE to be 1532 This puts us on track to achieve our goal to improve the average cooling efficiency of our data centers by 20 by 2025 against a base year of 2019,24
with landlords to improve the efficiency of support infrastructure toward meeting our goal,24
Use of renewable electricity In 2020 593 of the electricity consumed across IBMs global operations came from renewable sources That total includes 433 directly contracted from IBMs power suppliers in addition to the other 16 already in the electricity mix we received from the grid We continued to increase our usage of renewable electricity in 2021 executing seven new renewable electricity contracts and expanding our supply of renewables in six existing contracts and leases across seven countries IBM will publish its full 2021 progress in June 2022 when it releases its 2021 GHG emissions inventory,25
When reporting our consumption of renewable electricity we count only what is generated in the grid regions where our consumption actually occurs We do not purchase unbundled renewable energy certificates representing energy we cannot consume which would inflate our results For more information about how IBM calculates its consumption of renewable electricity please visit our website,24
Following the spinoff of IBMs managed infrastructure services business in 2021 the majority of IBMs data centers reside in thirdparty managed locations We have developed and negotiated lease terms that enable us to engage and collaborate,1
1 Power usage effectiveness PUE is the ratio of the total energy consumed by the data center divided by the energy consumed by the IT equipment The closer the value is to 1 the more energy efficient the data center and its cooling delivery are,24
2 Includes only those data centers that remained with IBM after the Kyndryl spinoff,18
CO2 emissions reduction In 2020 IBMs operational CO2 emissions decreased by 566 against base year 2005 adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures IBM does not purchase naturebased carbon offsets to claim any reduction of IBMs emissions IBM will publish its 2021 progress against its new GHG emissions reduction goal in June 2022 together with its 2021 GHG emissions inventory,25
Product energy efficiency IBM designs its products to be energy efficient incorporate recycled content and environmentally preferable materials and facilitate reuse and recycling at their end of life For more than two decades IBM has maintained a goal to improve the computing power delivered for each kilowatthour of electricity consumed for new server products as compared to equivalent previousgeneration products with a valid upgrade path IBMs latest Power10based server the E1080 was released in 2021 and improved the work delivered per unit of power,15

Conservation and biodiversity IBM has comprehensive programs and goals that help conserve natural resources and protect the biodiversity of our ecosystems,23
Water conservation Preserving water resources and safeguarding watersheds are important priorities IBMs water conservation goal is to achieve yeartoyear reductions in water withdrawals at larger IBM locations and data centers in waterstressed regions In 2021 withdrawals at these locations decreased by 12 versus 2020,20
IBMs primary use of water at locations subject to this goal is cooling and humidity control at offices and data centers 40 of total water withdrawals irrigation 31 of total water withdrawals and domestic water use in the workplace 29 of total water withdrawals In 2021 water withdrawal reduction efforts consisted of installing automatic irrigation systems and decreasing overall landscape irrigation upgrading cooling tower equipment and water storage tanks and ongoing maintenance of water pipes In addition IBM reused or recycled over 26500 cubic meters of water for landscape irrigation and to supplement makeup water used in cooling tower systems Further IBM is raising awareness of the importance of efficient use of water and conservation during new employee onboarding,20
IBM also continues to look for opportunities to reduce water use at locations outside of waterstressed regions In 2021 more than 40000 cubic meters of water were saved through various conservation projects including upgrades to reverse osmosis deionized water systems at IBM Research locations to allow for reuse of reject water,20
Paper and paperwoodbased packaging IBM has sustained a voluntary goal for the responsible sourcing of paper and paperwoodbased packaging since 2002 requiring that paper and paperwoodbased packaging directly procured by IBM come from suppliers that source from sustainably managed forests Suppliers must either disclose their sources for paper and paperwoodbased packaging to IBM or provide evidence that their sources have been certified to be from sustainably managed forests by an accredited thirdparty,15
IBM considers climaterelated risks in its enterprise risk management process See page 15 for more information,13
certification program such as the Forest Stewardship Council Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Sustainable Forestry Initiative or the Canadian Standards Association Group Sustainable Forest Management System standard In 2021 over 99 based on spend of the paper and paperwoodbased packaging IBM directly procured worldwide came from suppliers that warranted that the source was derived from sustainably managed forests,23
Biodiversity IBM has been a member of the Wildlife Habitat Council WHC since 1991 Four IBM sites IBM Corporate Headquarters New York IBM Research Triangle Park North Carolina and IBM Almaden Research Center and IBM Silicon Valley Laboratory California have maintained WHC Conservation Certification for their wildlife habitat management and conservation education programs for over 17 years In 2021 we worked with the WHC to develop education materials on how to create pollinatorfriendly habitats and provided them to IBM employees worldwide We also set a goal to plant 50 pollinator gardens at IBM locations globally by yearend 2023 Planning and design are underway as we work toward this goal,23
annual reduction in water withdrawals at data centers and other large IBM locations in waterstressed regions goal yearoveryear reduction,20
Local EcoTeamsemployees who volunteer to participate in a variety of local environmental initiativeslead projects to support ecosystem diversity and protection IBMs 28 EcoTeams which span 70 IBM locations across 21 countries completed approximately 180 activities in 2021 holding learning events planting trees maintaining pollinator gardens bird boxes and beehives participating in beach cleanups and more,23
In 2021 our operations generated 20700 MT of nonhazardous waste worldwide including IBMowned nonhazardous endof life machines parts and materials which accounted for 48 by weight of IBMs total nonhazardous waste generated worldwide We diverted 942 by weight of IBMs total nonhazardous waste from landfill and incineration Only 97 by weight of the total nonhazardous waste diverted from landfill and incineration was sent to wastetoenergy processes,19
Pollution prevention and waste management The best way to prevent pollution is to reduce the generation of waste at its source This has been a basic tenet of IBMs pollution prevention program since 1971 For waste that is generated we focus on preventing pollution through a comprehensive proactive waste management program IBMs waste management practices in order of preference are 1 prevention and source reduction 2 reuse 3 recycling 4 recovery 5 other treatment and 6 land disposal,19
Nonhazardous waste In 2021 IBM updated its nonhazardous waste goal to divert 90 or more by weight of IBMs total nonhazardous waste from landfill and incineration by 2025 through reuse recycling composting and wastetoenergy processes and to use wastetoenergy processes for no more than 10 by weight of the diverted waste This goal builds upon IBMs prior waste management goals across several decades,19
These results were achieved through proper management of endoflife IT materials by IBMs global network of equipment recovery centers that enhance IT product reuse and recycling improved office cafeteria and yard waste collection infrastructure resulting in better waste separation and the elimination of some nonessential singleuse plastic items and packaging from our cafeterias In addition IBM avoided the generation of 424 MT of waste and saved an estimated 200000 in disposal costs through a newly launched Furniture Donation Program for employees and external organizations in 2021,19
by weight diverted from landfill or incineration goal 90 by 2025,19
by weight of diverted waste sent to wastetoenergy processes goal no more than 10 established in 2021,19
Some batteries managed appropriately as hazardous waste were erroneously reported as nonhazardous waste during 201720 Although the change is extremely small we have updated the results with the quantity of this hazardous waste removed,19
by weight of total IT product waste sent by IBMs product endoflife operations to landfill or incineration for treatment goal not to exceed a combined 3 by weight,19
Nonessential singleuse plastics in cafeterias IBM set a goal in 2021 to further our efforts to eliminate nonessential singleuse plastic items eg cups straws cutlery plates carry bags and food containers from IBMmanaged cafeteria operations globally by 2025 Our focus in 2021 was to engage with our largest cafeteria vendor to identify singleuse plastic items used in IBMmanaged cafeterias at 37 locations spanning 17 countries Alternatives for nonessential singleuse plastic items that are either reusable or compatible with each sites local recyclingcomposting infrastructure were identified and will begin to roll out in 2022,19
Product packaging IBM set a goal in 2021 to eliminate nonessential plastic from the packaging of IBM logo hardware by yearend 2024 For essential plastic packaging our goal is to ensure such packaging is designed to be 100 reusable recyclable or compostable or incorporates 30 or more recycled content where technically feasible We established a team of packaging engineering and logistics experts to execute the goal The team completed an inventory of plastic packaging items and determined whether the items were essential We have started to eliminate nonessential items and identify possible alternatives for the remaining items,15
To date 18 singleuse plastic packaging elimination and material substitution projects have been identified and are at various stages of investigation and implementation Two specific projects completed in 2021 were,15
used to protect partsmachines from weather The estimated annual material savings from implementation of this project is 19 MT or 238000 linear meters of stretch wrap,15
content polyethylene cushions used for IBM z Systems Power and storage products These efforts have reduced the use of virgin packaging materials by 60 The estimated annual material savings from implementation of this project is 90 MT,15
Product reuse and recycling For many decades IBM has developed products with consideration for ease of their servicing and upgradability and for the reuse recyclability and recoverability of materials used in the products We also have a longstanding goal to reuse or recycle endoflife products such that the amount of product waste sent by our operations to landfills or for incineration does not exceed a combined 3 by weight of the total amount processed In 2021 IBM processed more than 18000 MT of endoflife products and product waste with 977 by weight reused resold or sent for recycling 20 sent to wasteto energy for final disposition and 03 sent to landfills or for incineration Since we began reporting on product disposal in 1995 IBM has processed 112 million MT 246 billion pounds of products and product waste worldwide,19
Remediation At IBM we take swift action to clean up any environmental contamination found at former and current sites and we are committed to taking proactive measures to prevent future contamination When groundwater contamination was first discovered at one of IBMs sites in 1977 we voluntarily initiated groundwater monitoring at our manufacturing and development locations worldwide Today IBM has more than 2000 monitoring wells in place at its current and former locations,20
In 2021 IBM operated remediation systems that removed approximately 10200 pounds of solvents from groundwater and soil vapor at three currently operating IBM locations and 12 former IBM locations IBM also has financial responsibility for remediation at one additional former location,20
Under the US Superfund law IBM is also involved in remediation activities at some thirdparty sites in the United States The Superfund law creates retroactive responsibility for all parties that may have sent waste or otherwise contributed to contamination at a site regardless of whether the sites operations andor the shipments of waste to that site were legal or even best practices at the time Currently IBM is participating in remediation activities or bears some financial responsibility at 19 Superfund sites,19
Supplier environmental goals Since 2010 IBM has required all firsttier suppliers to establish their own social and environmental management systems as well as set quantifiable goals and publicly disclose progress toward those goals in the areas of energy management GHG emissions reduction and waste management This is an important aspect of IBMs deployment of the RBA code with its suppliers of hardware software and services,25
In 2021 IBM established three goals to help accelerate GHG emissions reductions in our supply chain and to encourage suppliers to take ownership and build their capabilities across a broad range of sustainability topics These goals,25
Require key suppliers in emissionsintensive business sectors to set an emissions reduction goal by 2022 addressing their Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions that is aligned with scientific recommendations from the UN IPCC to limit Earths warming to 15 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels During 2021 we worked with logistics airline and hotel suppliers representing 28 of suppliers covered by the scope of our goal to collect information about their emissions reduction goals and we have started an assessment to determine their alignment with the UN IPCC recommendations In 2022 we will contact the remaining inscope suppliers complete an assessment of their targets and work with any suppliers not yet meeting the goal to establish action plans,25
