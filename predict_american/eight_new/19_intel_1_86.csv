Human rights are the fundamental rights freedoms and standards of treatment to which all people are entitled Intels Global Human Rights Principles adopted in 2009 formalize our commitment to respecting human rights embody common principles laid out in multiple frame works including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and apply to all employees and contingent workers including those in our subsidiaries,10
We are committed to maintaining and improving processes to avoid complicity in human rights violations related to our operations supply chain and products We also look for opportunities to apply our technology to support the advancement of human rights We have established an integrated approach to managing human rights across our business including boardlevel oversight and the involvement of seniorlevel Manage ment Review Committees For example our annual Combating Modern Slavery and Ensuring Transparent Supply Chains statement is discussed with our Board and signed by one of our directors Our Corporate Responsibility Office manages our human rights program and responsibility is also embedded across the company through a crossIntel Human Rights Steering Committee and close partnerships with global teams that develop and implement policies and actions related to our human rights risks,10
In 2021 we added our human rights program to an annual Ethics and Legal Compliance review process which resulted in increased visibility and awareness of human rights topics across the organization Key learnings will help to drive further improvements,10
We also meet throughout the year with external stakeholders and experts on human rights to continue to inform and evolve our human rights policies and oversight processes In 2021 we discussed human rights issues with our investors and NGOs We also are a signatory to the UN Global Compact a member of the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights and a participant in the Centre for Sport and Human Rights and the Partnership on AI,10
Our goal is to cultivate a safe diverse and respectful work environment where employees can thrive and innovate See Employee Health Safety and Wellness in the Responsible section and Inclusive Workforce in the Inclusive section of this report for more detail In 2021 we deployed a new holistic human rights training course for employees to help raise their awareness about Intels initiatives and ways they can take action in their roles to advance our human rights strategy The course has received positive feedback from employees and we will continue to expand it,10
The Intel Environmental Health and Safety Policy guides us to provide a safe and injuryfree workplace through our core safety programs and injuryreduction initiatives not only for our employees but also for contractors work ing at our sites In addition our recently updated Global Water Policy reinforces our respect for the human right to water by helping us responsibly meet our operational needs as well as those of our communities,9
As a founding member of the Responsible Business Alliance RBA we hold our suppliers accountable to the same expectations we have for ourselves Over the past decade we have directly engaged with our suppliers to verify compliance and build capacity to address risks of forced and bonded labor and other human rights issues We also engage with indirect suppliers through our programs on forced and bonded labor and responsible minerals Our significant invest ments of time and resources are aimed at influencing systemlevel industrywide improvements to protect and empower workers in the global electronics supply chain and to reduce community impacts We continue our efforts to combat forced and bonded labor in our supply chain which includes prohibiting holding worker passports and charging workers fees to obtain employ ment Since 2014 we have remediated the return of over 25 million in fees to suppliers workers,11

We have long been committed to respecting privacy and security related to the development and use of our products We practice privacy and security by design and our Security Development Lifecycle SDL processes define actions deliverables and checkpoints aimed at integrating security and privacy protections into our products and services Intel does not participate in any efforts to decrease security in technology and does not design back doors for access into our products The Intel Privacy Notice outlines our general approach to managing personal data In addition we advocate for global policies and standards to protect privacy and data security,1
As the range of products and services we offer broadens and changes we evaluate potential concerns about how technology products may be used to infringe on human rights The challenges range from product misuse and limits on freedom of expression to health and safety concerns that may arise from new technologies We updated the Intel Global Human Rights Principles to clarify language regarding our expectations on product responsibility and human rights We continuously improve our processes for operationalizing this work Most Intel products are generalpurpose computing products that can be incorporated into systems and,14
applications and that are sold to end users by distribu tors system manufacturers and others and not directly by Intel While we do not always know nor can we control what products our customers create or the applications end users may develop we do not support or tolerate our products being used to violate human rights When we become aware of a concern that Intel products are being used by a business partner in connection with abuses of human rights we restrict or cease business with the third party until we have high confidence that our products are not being used to violate human rights,10

More than 9000 tier 11 suppliers in 87 countries provide direct materials for our production processes intellectual property tools and machines for our factories logistics and packaging services software office materials and travel services for Intel We also rely on others to man ufacture assemble and test some of our components and products See a list of our Top 100 Production and Service Suppliers in the Appendix,15
1 Tier 1 suppliers are companies from which Intel makes direct purchases Among Intels 9000 tier 1 suppliers we identify approximately 400 critical suppliers that we directly engage through our capabilitybuilding programs These suppliers represent more than75 of our spends Beyond this we engage with critical tier 2 suppliers through our programs on forced and bonded labor responsible minerals and supplier diversity Tier 2 suppliers are companies from which Intels tier 1 suppliers make direct purchases,17
We continue to collaborate extensively with supply chainrelated organizationsincluding the Responsible Business Alliance RBA and its Responsible Minerals Initiative and Responsible Labor Initiative the Semicon ductor Industry Association and SEMIto help set electronics industrywide standards develop audit processes conduct training address thirdparty anticorruption issues and more,17
We expect our suppliers and their suppliers to comply with the Intel Code of Conduct Intels Supplier policies and the RBA Code of Conduct RBA Code The RBA Code describes industry environmental social and ethical standards and is consistent with the Intel Global Human Rights Principles the Intel Statement on Combating Modern Slavery and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights For more read our RBA Commitment Letter,17
We also expect and enable our suppliers to develop their own corporate responsibility strategies policies and processes set goals and report on their perfor mance engage with and audit their own suppliers and develop manage and regularly test their business continuity plans In 2021 we continued to review ongoing COVID19 and supply chain challenges through our Supply Chain Command Center,17
Our supplier development monitoring and enforcement efforts are integrated across our commodity teams This integration allows us to scale our coverage support supplier progress and influence suppliers that may be reluctant to meet our requirements We communicate our expectations in our supplier contracts and request forproposal documents on our supplier website at meetings and training events and in annual letters to suppliers,17
We hold ourselves accountable to meet or exceed the same standards that we set for our suppliers and audit ourselves to the same protocols Every year we complete the RBA SelfAssessment Questionnaire SAQ and publish the resultson our corporate website We follow,0
the RBA Validated Assessment Program VAP to conduct audits of our finished goods factoriesIn 2021 we conducted an RBA VAP audit of our facilities in Kulim Malaysia and addressed all findings In 2022 we plan to have RBA audits of our facilities in Vietnam and Costa Rica,14
Strengthening Supplier Capabilities For more than a decade we have worked to help less mature and evolving suppliers build critical sustainability and corporate responsibility acumen including a focus on compliance with the RBA and our Code of Conduct expectations and requirements We have delivered a broad range of nocost support options for suppliers including online resources interactive training sessions and connection to external resources such as the RBA and other NGO training and conferences,17
Safety Programs We set high safety training and performance expectations during our contracting process and orientation for new suppliers We validate that suppliers have robust safety management systems and employee safety training programs in place and evaluate supplier safety performance for compliance with the American National Standards Institute ANSI standards OSHA regulations and Intels minimum safety requirements,9
In 2021 we partnered with more than 50 suppliers to elevate their safety management systems to ensure safe work practices at Intel sites In addition we worked with 43 suppliers to close 131 occupational health and safety audit findings and improve worker conditions in their factories,9
Beyond our core capabilitybuilding offerings we have long engaged with supply chain sustainability consul tants to offer suppliers training and programs focused on topics like workhours management occupational health and safety environmental issues and prevention of forced and bonded labor,11
Supplier Diversity and Inclusion We are making solid progress on our accelerated commitment to a diverse and inclusive supply chain and our 2030 RISE goal to double annual spending with diverse suppliers2 to 2 billion For more details see Supplier Diversity and Inclusion in the Inclusive section of this report,8
Advancing Supplier Leadership and Accountability We have established several programs to advance our supplier leadership and accountability as well as ensure the latest information is made available through education and collaboration,17
Supplier Program to Accelerate Responsibility and Commitment SPARC This initiative is designed to help our SPARC suppliers build internal capacity around corporate responsibility through rigorous annual commitments to compliance transparency and capabilitybuilding We have increased the number of suppliers required to participate in SPARC over the past eight years as we have broadened our scope to include additional programs and requirements This increase represents suppliers selected using our risk based approach and those providing critical materials and services to IntelParticipating suppliers represented over 78 of Intels managed supply chain spends in 2021 We continue to raise expectations for our suppliers and expand requirements to encompass a broader set of focus areas In 2022 we will set the stage for growing environmental concerns and regulations addressing current global initiatives,17
2 We recognize diverse suppliers as businesses that are 51 owned and operated by at least one of the following women minorities as defined by the country or region where the business was established veteransservicedisabled veterans persons who are lesbian gay bisexual or transgender or persons who are disabled While Intel recognizes these categories they may vary in accordance with local law,8
Applying our riskbased approach we continue to use the RBA program as the industry standard for our validated audits for manufacturing suppliers In addition we apply the riskbased criteria to complete targeted assessments of our nonmanufacturing suppliers Our sustainability criteria have also been embedded into our supplier quality assessment process to further extend our reach into the supply chain For priority and major findings by category and subcategory visit the Report Builder In certain circumstances the same facility may be audited multiple times in a calendar year We treat each individual audit of a single facility as a unique audit in the above table Despite continued challenges due to COVID19 in 2021 over 157 audits were conducted across 89 suppliers Audits that were planned in 2021 but not executed due to COVID19 restrictions and still deemed necessary are included in our 2022 plan Cumulatively 627 supplier sites had received audits by the end of 2021,17
3 Previous years figures are updated to reflect the most current information as new audit data becomes available,12
Supplier Report Card SRC We have a regular review and scoring process for our SRC to grade suppliers for product availability cost quality sustainability ethics supplier diversity and environmental and human rights performance security safety technology and customer satisfaction These processes allow for executivelevel dialogue on past and future performance and remind suppliers of our expectations,17
Assessments and Audits Supplier assessments and audits cover more than 300 environmental safety and human rights factors and help us determine a suppliers risk profile The audits conducted by a mix of third parties and Intel personnel follow the RBA VAP and help us identify where immediate action is needed and where longer term corrective targeted action plans should be put in place In 2021 35 of the combined RBA audits were followup or closure audits to verify whether the findings from a previous audit had been addressed We strive to audit 100 of highrisk supplier sites within a twoyear cycle We have instituted a process of unannounced audits to follow up on credible reports of noncompliance but we did not need to conduct any such audits in 2021,17
Targeted Action Plans When a supplier does not make sufficient progress in addressing audit findings or has particularly egregious issues we work with the supplier to quickly develop and implement a strong corrective action plan Supplier progress is reviewed quarterly until we have verified that all key issues have been closed and that processes have been put in place to prevent recur rence If satisfactory progress is not made we may take additional action such as not awarding new business conditional use status until issues are resolved or when necessaryending the supplier relationship While complete closure of some issues can take several years we work to close egregious issues within 30 days,17
We help suppliers with targeted action plans make progress in multiple ways Our actions may include conducting additional reviews such as unannounced audits and increasing the frequency of contact between Intel executives and supplier senior management,17
Recognizing and Rewarding Performance We provide regular feedback to suppliers on their overall progress and achievements and integrate corporate responsibility considerations into our Excellence Partnership Inclusion and Continuous Improvement EPIC program EPIC recognizes suppliers that have demonstrated outstanding distinguished and valued performance For more information and a list of recently recognized suppliers visit our Top 100 Production and Service Suppliers in the Appendix of this report,17
In 2021 we asked approximately 116 tier 1 suppliers that have higher environmental impacts to submit data on their own carbon footprints through the CDP Supply Chain Climate Change Questionnaire Of those suppliers 99 submitted the questionnaire and 92 of them made their responses public giving both Intel and other stakeholders information about the environmental performance of our supply chain Using information provided in our suppliers CDP Climate Change Questionnaire helps us ensure that we are focusing on the largest climate change impacts,17
Supplier Environmental Impact We partner with our suppliers to decrease their waste generated water usage and greenhouse gas emissions and thereby reduce our own environmental impact lower supply chain risk and can decrease costs We also partner with our tier 1 chemical and gas suppliers on green chemistry initiatives Our procurement teams work with our logistics and packaging suppliers to drive changes in the materials we use to ship products,17
We also sent the CDP water questionnaire to 52 suppliers that are located in waterstressed regions We achieved a 98 response rate with 94 of the 52 suppliers publicly sharing their responses As a result of our efforts we were recognized in the CDP Supplier Engagement Leaderboard for the fifth consecutive year,17

We achieved an EHS training milestone in 2021 with an all timehigh 555000 EHS training,2
Health and safety training creates awareness and enables our employees to better understand their safety responsibilities Our training system covers information needed for specific jobs such as electrical safety ergo nomics control of hazardous materials and chemical safety in different languages and includes webbased instructorled and onthejob training and innovative learning methodologies such as virtual and augmented reality We launched an EHS training tracker in 2021 to support both compliance and risk reduction,9
In 2021 our manufacturing supply chain and technology development organizations introduced quarterly trackable manager Safety TALKs to encourage proactive oneonone discussions between managers and employees on various safety topics We also began requiring all employees to complete Safety Always training to boost safety awareness across the company In addition we implemented a new requirement for all nonfactory employees to complete Office Ergonomics training to build awareness of office ergonomic risks proper ergonomic workstation setup and ergonomic services available We tracked completion of both classes as a 2021 safety leading indicator and reported strong performance at 98 and 94 respectively,9
During 2021 EHS partnered with our Corporate Services and Global Supply Chain organizations to research and recommend chairs and desks for employees working remotely and provided a portal to enable easy ordering of ergonomically approved equipment worldwide In addition we developed a onestop Future of Work ergonomics site to provide easy employee access to all key ergonomic services and reporting information,17
Recognizing that early intervention is critical for good ergonomic health and the prevention of injuries in 2021 we piloted a proactive employee concierge program called Ergo which provides employees with oneonone advice and proactive ergonomic assessments to help address both remote and inoffice setups Ergo includes an easy online tool for employees to sign up for initial consultations and followup assessments The pilot resulted in an increase in employee reporting of intermittent discomfort or concerns and 90 of those surveyed reported that they would recommend the program to a friend We plan to expand the program globally in 2022,9
We also continued to expand our yearround multimedia Safety Always employee awareness campaign In 2021 we organized our first virtual global safety week which included multiple wellreceived internal and external speakers The cam paign also included regular widely read employee communications on topics such as reporting ergonomics and situational safety,9
Intel ended 2021 with an Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA recordable rate of093 per 100 employees compared to the most recently published US semiconductor industry average recordable rate of 070 in 20201 Our days away case rate2 was 02 in 2021 compared to the semiconductor industry average of 02 in 2020 Ergonomicrelated or cumulative trauma disorders CTDs remained the most prevalent type of injury experienced at Intel in 2021 accounting for 65 of all reports followed by strainssprains Office ergonomic injuries predominantly from employees working from home and COVID19 cases accounted for the Intel recordable rate increase we observed in 2021 compared to 2020 We had one employee fatality in 2021 There were 31 highconsequence injuries during 2021 with 32 CTD injuries and 32 strainsprain injuries We have integrated learnings into our 2022 ergonomics programs early intervention focus plans,9

agement engagement in our safety programs For our wellness goal we will continue to further expand our wellness,14
program access to our global employee population over the next four years with a target to reach 100 of global,8
employees by end of 2025 and then to increase the participation rate for all employees to 50,11
Globally we have 37 onsite health clinics to attend to workrelated employee health and safety needs At our sites in Arizona New Mexico and Oregon we also have Health for Life Centers that provide primary care and specialty services including acupuncture chiropractic behavioral health services and physical therapy in a safe and inclusive environment for our employees and their eligible dependents The Health for Life Centers have administered hundreds of COVID19 vaccinations and in 2021 delivered approximately 10000 virtual visits,9
In 2021 in support of our safety culture and wellness goals we further increased the percentage of employees who have the opportunity to respond to our safety cul ture surveys and achieved 50 employee participation Our Safety Star Program continues in its fourth year in 2022 and we have adopted multiple leading indicators to assess progress drive for earlier reporting of ergo nomic injuries at the first sign of fatigue or discomfort and promote easier access to services We also continue to adapt our EHS services to support different work models including hybrid onsite and remote workers,9
Rate based on 100 employees working full time for one year Data as of March 1 2022 Certain historical figures have been updated based on new reported cases received,11
We have continued to focus during the COVID19 pandemic on ensuring workers in our supply chain are protected from human rights abuses Our 2030 RISE goals reflect our intent to drive human rights despite pandemic economic or technological headwinds As such in 2021 Intel began driving knowledge of and compliance to the RBA Code of Conduct deeper into our supply chain than in previous years,11
Due to supply chain shortages many companies in the electronics industry have faced severe worker shortages which has created pressure for longer working hours and fewer days off for workers Intel has continued to press suppliers to abide by the RBA Code of Conduct including allowing workers a day of rest each week limiting workers to no more than 60 hours of work per week and making all overtime voluntary,11
We have worked to build a strong system to detect and address risks of forced and bonded laboramong our suppliers and their recruiting and labor agents including reaching over 135 suppliers at the tier 2 level Our Statement on Combating Modern Slavery details the expectations we have for ourselves and our suppliers including prohibitions against holding worker passports and charging workers fees to obtain or keep employ ment Since 2014 our ongoing assessments and efforts to reach deeper into the supply chain have positively affected more than 46000 workers in our extended supply chain Positive impacts have included the return of over 25 million in fees to more than 21000 workers by our suppliers since 2014 A fee returned could equate to approximately three to five months of base pay depending on location and situation In some instances we have faced challenges in gaining cooperation from suppliers in repaying workers quickly we work closely with suppliers to determine acceptable remedies and put systems in place to prevent such issues in the future,11
Findings that May Trigger Forced and Bonded Labor Risks,11
We proactively work to identify and help suppliers close findings that we believe may be trigger factors for forced and bonded labor Some historic numbers have been restated due to the timing of reporting,11
Many challenges exist in combating issues related to forced and bonded labor including lack of full visibility into our complex changing multitier supply chain To increase our reach and positive impact since 2018 we have required that approximately 50 of our suppliers work with at least three of their own major suppliers to assess and address their risks of forced and bonded labor Our suppliers continue to complete all deliverables and demonstrate changes to tier 2 supplier policies and procedures and stronger engagements with recruiting and labor agents resulting in the return of over 12 million in fees to their foreign workers since the start of our program,11
Importantly our suppliers report benefits as a result of their improved practices such as reduced business risks better and larger pools of candidates a more satisfied workforce and higher worker retentionall of which can lead to improved productivity and product quality as well as positive social impacts,8
Industry Collaboration through Training Collaboration is key to addressing broad longstanding issues Intel cofounded and serves on the working group of the multiindustry multistakeholder Responsible Labor Initiative RLI which aims to protect and promote the rights of vulnerable workers In partnership with RLI and its members Intel helped create the Practical Guide to Due Diligence on Recruitment Fees in International Supply Chains which provides guidelines and examples of best practices to achieve fee repayment The RLI has established the Responsible Recruiting Program a recruiting agent maturity model,11
In 2021 Intel further sponsored virtual training sessions Mitigating Risks of Forced Labor and Impacts of COVID19 on Migrant Workers in the Supply Chain and will continue to sponsor them in 2022,11
For more information on our work on human rights in our supply chain see Respecting Human Rights in the Our Business section of this report,10
Description Scale our supplier responsibility programs to ensure respect for human rights across 100 of our tier 1 contracted suppliers and higher risk tier 2 suppliers1,17

Looking Ahead In 2022 our target is to assess validate andwhere neededmitigate the risk level of an additional 12 of suppliers We are also evaluating the impact of IDM20,17
supply chain changes In addition we will continue to assess and audit highrisk tier 2 suppliers on Intel sites,17
1 Tier 1 suppliers are companies from which Intel makes direct purchases approximately 9000 suppliers Tier 1 contracted suppliers are subject to formal agreements with Intel based on the products and services provided and spends Tier 2 suppliers are companies from which Intels tier 1 suppliers make direct purchases,17
According to the RBA the payment of recruitment fees by workers to obtain work is one of the most widespread factors that can contribute to situations of forced labor Intel helped create a guide that details best practices for repayment,11
Like many companies in the electronics industry Intel and its suppliers use minerals in manufacturing Over a dozen years ago Intel began work to responsibly source conflict minerals1 and in 2017 we expanded our efforts to also address cobalt in our supply chain We are proud of the significant progress we have made as a company and as an industry but we know that there is more work to be done A key technology initiative in our 2030 RISE strategy is to significantly expand our impact in responsible minerals and accelerate the creation of new sourcing standards,17
Intels strategy is to maintain the positive progress weve made to date on 3TG tantalum tin tungsten and gold and cobalt and to proactively address emerging risks from the expanding scope of materials and geographies Our ambition is to apply our learnings from over a decade and work with our industry to broaden and accelerate the creation of sourcing standards for a much wider set of minerals across additional conflictaffected and highrisk areas CAHRAs2,17
More information is available on our Responsible Minerals website Our Responsible Minerals program Responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy and due diligence practices address minerals originating in CAHRAs and are aligned to the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict Affected and HighRisk Areas OECD Guidance,17
Beyond Conflict Minerals Driving a Responsibly Sourced Mineral Supply Chain In 2021 we sent our first expanded minerals survey for aluminum copper nickel and silver to suppliers contributing these materials in our Intelmanufactured microprocessors This is an important step in our RISE strategy as we begin mapping our supply chains for our highest priority minerals Although sourcing of these minerals is not yet widely reported we received a response from 89 of relevant suppliers We are con tinuing to pursue information on smelters and refiners in our extended supply chainthose that supply our direct suppliers Alist of smelters and refiners reported can be found on our website,17
To contribute to standards and help define and engage in due diligence within the copper supply chain Intel is an active partner member of The Copper Mark participat ing in its Risk Readiness Assessment RRA Technical Revision Committee and Technical Working Group We are continuing to map our supply chain for targeted minerals as well as other priority minerals such as zinc and lead,17
Additionally we continue to partner with industry associations to ensure standards are in place to enable our ultimate goal of responsible sourcing for all the minerals in our supply chain We will continue to identify the highest priority minerals in pursuit of our 2030 RISE Goals,17
Intel also recognizes the local socioeconomic impor tance of the artisanal and smallscale mining ASM sector in CAHRAs and seeks to assist ASM sites in meeting downstream compliance requirements through the Better Mining ASM Mine Monitoring Program in partnership with Responsible Minerals Initiative RMI and RCS Global Intel also supported a digital suite designed specifically for the ASM sector which will create new pathways to track access and share data about practices in mining communities,10
Maintaining a connection and providing support to the communities that we depend on in our vast global supply chain is a crucial component to our responsible minerals program,17
Connecting with Mining Communities Intel recognizes the importance of direct engagement with mining communities to address human rights issues in our supply chain As a complement to our due diligence program we have an ongoing program to dedicate resources and partner with expert civil society organizations to identify and remedy the challenges of the mining communities that source our products,10
A few examples of projects supported by Intel in 2021 are Congo Power an alliance providing mining areas with clean power specifically funding the power needs for community training in addition to the educational programming at the Dr Mukwege School PACTRMI Youth Vocational Training Program aimed at providing mining alternatives to Congolese youths and the development of the worlds first Congofocused North American collection and repository for Congolese written documents on the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC at the University of British Columbia library We believe that helping to empower marginalized workers in our supply chain is a crucial step in promoting human rights,10
Our Due Diligence Continues 3TG and Cobalt Intels responsible 3TG and cobalt program aligned with the OECD Guidance focuses on three primary areas,12
Risk Identification Each year we conduct a supply chain survey to identify the smelters and refiners that process the 3TG and cobalt contained in the products supplied to Intel and the country of origin of minerals used We then compare those smelters and refiners to the list of facilities that conform to a responsible minerals sourcing validation program such as RMIs Responsible Minerals Assurance Process RMAP We use the information to identify potential mineral supply chain risks,17
Risk Mitigation When we identify potential risks we conduct further due diligence which may include onsite smelter or refinery visits or virtual outreach Such visits or virtual outreach help identify risks encourage smelters and refiners to participate in an audit program to validate their sourcing practices and drive risk mitigation for human rights impacts When necessary we will disen gage from mineral supply chains that cannot uphold our responsible minerals sourcing standards Additionally we have increased virtual outreach to smelters and refiners already participating in a thirdparty audit program to ensure participation continuity minimize disruption and provide additional support throughout the pandemic,17
Supporting InRegion Sourcing We believe that the creation and support of responsibly sourced3 minerals from CAHRAs improve the lives of the people in the regions In addition to our independent project resourcing our membership in and support of the PublicPrivate Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade PPA and European Partnership for Responsible Minerals EPRM directly support regional projects that enable responsibly sourced minerals from CAHRAs by helping to implement programs that are consistent with the OECD Guidance and supported RMI programs Intel is also a member of the International Tin Associations International Tin Supply Chain Initiative iTSCi a trace ability program to help ensure traceability of responsibly mined minerals from mine to smelter,17
3TG Through our annual supply chain survey process in 2021 99 of the relevant suppliers and refiners reported in our supply chain are deemed responsibly sourced through their conformance to andor participa tion in a responsible minerals assurance program,17
Cobalt Intel used the RMI Cobalt Response Template CRT to survey all suppliers contributing cobalt to our products In 2021 we received responses from 100 of suppliers surveyed Intel conducted risk mitigation in our supply chain including smelter outreach and country of origin assessments as well as working with direct suppliers to facilitate alternative sourcing where appropriate Our goal is to responsibly source all cobalt in our products Through RMIs cobalt working group and smelter outreach we are pursuing all smelters and refiners in our cobalt supply chain to participate in RMAP See a complete list of facilities that processed cobalt in Intels supply chain based on supplier responses to our 2021 survey,17
Intels longterm leadership in initiatives such as the RMI and PPA allows us to regularly collaborate on the issue of responsible minerals sourcing with other companies industries governments and civil society Such collabo ration is crucial to identify and address risks associated with mineral extraction and trade in complex mineral supply chains All participants from the mines through device manufacturers have a responsibility to ensure that they do not contribute to human rights abuses We continue to advance responsible sourcing across our product lines materials and industry as our business and the world landscape evolve,17
Our annual conflict minerals disclosure filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission contains additional information about our 3TG and cobalt due diligence practices,12
1 Conflict minerals as defined by the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC is a broad term that means tin tantalum tungsten and gold 3TG regardless of whether these minerals finance conflict in the DRC or adjoining countries,19
2 CAHRAs as defined by OECD are identified by the presence of armed conflict widespread violence or other risks of harm to people Armed conflict may take a variety of forms such as a conflict of international or noninternational character which may involve two or more states or may consist of wars of liberation or insurgencies civil wars etc Highrisk areas may include areas of political instability or repression institutional weakness insecurity collapse of civil infrastructure and widespread violence Such areas are often characterized by widespread human rights abuses and violations of national or international law,10
3 Responsibly sourced refers to products from suppliers supply chains smelters and refiners that based on our due diligence are in line with,17
current global standards and respect human rights in every aspect of their practice,10

Transparency and open sharing of our data enables us to both celebrate progress and identify key areas for action and improvement In 2021 we continued our focus on career development and progression of diverse talent We saw absolute numbers increase in all categories Some of the numbers from 2020 to 2021 did not increase much as percentages orin some cases decreased because of the unprecedented growth in our company For example the percentage of Intel employees who identify as veterans dropped slightly from 73 in 2020 to 72 in 2021 yet the number of employees who identify as veteransincreased by roughly 150 In addition our global representation of technical women declined from 252 in 2020 to 243 in 2021 but more technical womensome 26000work at Intel than at any time in our recenthistory,8

Pay Equity At Intel we strive for an inclusive and fully engaged workforce that is reflective of the best and brightest talent in our industry Since 2019 we have achieved gender pay equity globally and we continue to maintain raceethnicity pay equity in the US We achieve pay equity by closing the gap in average pay between employees of different genders or raceethnicity in the same or similar roles after accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences such as location time at grade level and tenure,11
Intels legal and human resources teams work with thirdparty experts using proven statistical modeling techniques to monitor and advance global pay equity Our comprehensive analysis includes base pay bonuses and stock grants Individual employees who are identified as having a gap through this analysis receive appropriate adjustments,11
A key component of our pay equity strategy is our commitment to transparency which helps us to hold ourselves accountable and encourage action by others In support of this goal we first publicly released our EEO1 survey pay data in 2019 we feel it is important to continue collecting and disclosing diversity and inclusion data publicly,8
Inclusive Culture Inclusion is one of Intels core values and it is at the heart of our culture We have taken actions to integrate our inclusion expectations into our policies performance management systems leadership expectations annual bonus metrics and employee surveys,8
The Intel Code of Conduct and Intel Global Human Rights Principles set out our commitment to nondis crimination and to provide a workplace free of harassment We have redesigned our employee performance management system and leadership promotions process to focus on results delivered as well as how those results are achieved through alignment with Intels values and commitment to inclusion,8

ERGs Intel has ERGs organized around race national origin sexual orientation and gender identity parent hood disabilities education faith and beliefs and other common affinities ERGs can serve as powerful networks offering opportunities for personal and profes sional development access to mentors and volunteer activities that facilitate teamwork and build camaraderie We encourage employees to participate in ERGs beyond their personal affinities to build relationships with a wider community and exchange learnings We believe that retention rates increase when people feel included in deep and wideranging networks,8
We chartered a new ERG in 2021 Partners for Inclusion and Equity which provides a forum for ongoing safe and open conversations about the impacts of racism Membership in this new ERG grew to nearly 400 in under a year,8
Our ERGs are part of the engine that drives community and inclusion at Intel The vast variety of these groups reflects how,8
Intel tries to include and empower every employee to embrace a sense of belonging,8

Inclusion for Everyone We recognize and respect the worth and dignity of every employee and want everyone to contribute at their full potential We promote and sustain a sense of belonging for everyone but have identified areas where we need to do better First we recognized that some of our diversity and inclusion efforts have been more US focused even though Intel is a global company We have adjusted by ensuring that global goals are a significant part of our 2030 RISE strategy and by integrating all regions even more in our processes,8
We identified our factory workers as another group we could better engage We are launching a program to increase engagement with our factory workers and provide alternative ways of engagement for all,11
We also recognized that some communities have felt excluded from our diversity and inclusion efforts Our efforts have been focused on equity of opportunity and changes in culture that should benefit everyone We have taken steps to make it more explicit that we want to include everyone in our efforts,8
In 2021 a group of men and women from Intel business groups around the globe organized Intels International Mens Day to celebrate mens positive contributions to society promote positive male role models and focus on mens health and wellbeing The event included partnerships with several Intel ERGs as well as external organizations such as Movember and the Better Man Conference The celebration attracted more than 1000 attendees and included 24 speakers from nine countries,9

Our vision to grow a diverse and inclusive global supply chain includes increasing our annual spending with diverseowned suppliers as well as working with others to expand and enable inclusive sourcing practices across the industry,17
On our path to reach our 2030 RISE goal to increase annual spending with diverse suppliers to 2 billion globally we have set three major milestones focused on spending with womenowned suppliers outside of the US and minorityowned suppliers globally including US Blackowned suppliers,17
We put these milestones in place to advance racial and gender economic equity We are expanding opportunities for diverseowned companies to compete for new business and increase their positive impact in their communities and our industry,8
Inclusion of diverseowned suppliers is built into our operations and outlined in our Supplier Diversity Policy We have integrated requirements for including diverse suppliers into our supplier bidding selection and management processes and in our EPIC award We apply these expectations and requirements to tier 12 suppliers and we also expect our nondiverse suppliers to report their own spending with diverseowned suppliers and subcontractors,17

During 2021 we continued our work on energyefficiency initiatives and have made substantial progress in replacing traditional system sleep and idle states with Modern Standby Intel maintained 100 adoption of Modern Standby on notebook PC designs using 12th Generation Intel Core processors ADLP and ADLU The transition of desktop PCs to Modern Standby ramped in 2021 with a doubling of design wins through ecosystem partnerships,15
Intel collaborated with the technology industry to enable customers to successfully transition to Tier2 specifications of California Energy Commission CEC computers standard approximately 15 annual PC energy use reduction We also worked with industry partners and the Consumer Technology Association to influence US computer and display standards to align with the existing CEC standards and future CEC revi sions This alignment is critical to prevent a patchwork of statelevel certification requirements Working with the European Commission and other stakeholders on EU Lot 3 Computers regulation revision Intel continued to make progress with DIGITALEUROPE on new software tools for PC active mode energyefficiency labeling recom mendations We also worked with government policy makers In South Korea to influence the direction of the new version of computer standard,12
For server energy efficiency Intel collaborated with technology industry consortia and European Standard ization Organizations to support development of new harmonized standards in support of EU Lot 9 server regulation already in effect We also contributed to server energyefficiency standards initiatives in the UK and India In China as part of industry consortia we are working with China National Institute of Standardization to agree on a workable solution for SPEC SERT suite and Chinas indigenous benchmark tool BenchSEE to coexist in order to comply with Chinas upcoming server energy efficiency standard,24
We have estimated the GHG emissions due to energy consumption by Intel processors sold in 2021 The annual and lifetime emissions of Intel processors when used in customers compute applications ie server desktop notebook and workstation equate to approximately 5264000 and 22903000 metric tons of CO2e respectively,25
The decrease in annual and lifetime emissions compared with 2020 is driven primarily by significant improvements in our server CPU calculation methodology for product energy usage and associated GHG emissions Refine ments for 2021 included incorporating both enterprise and cloud data center models While there was no change to traditional enterprise data center methodology the cloud data center model required significant refinement to CPU percent average active power in line with CPU usages in todays data centers Further refinements for 2021 included accounting for the emissions reduction impacts of the use of renewable electricity by our cust omers Specifically calculations included consideration of cloud service provider publicly reported use of renewable electricity in data centers Yearly emissions due to energy consumption of Intel processors are expected to trend downwards as our customers further adopt renewable electricity initiatives and goals Net lifetime emissions after accounting for renewable electricity is going down even with higher percent average active power in cloud data centers,25

Semiconductor fabrication requires significant water use By responsibly managing our water use guided by our Global Water Policy we can meet our business needs as well as those of our communities In 2021 we returned and restored approximately 991 by volume of our fresh water withdrawals to our communities through efficient water management water reuse and project funding that enabled water restoration in local watersheds,20
Our water strategy has three main objectives conserve water used in our operations collaborate on water ini tiatives with local communities and create technology solutions to help others reinvent how they use and conserve water As a part of our 2030 RISE goals we aim to achieve net positive water by conserving 60 billion gallons of water cumulative from 2020 and funding water projects that will restore more fresh water than we consume to our local watersheds,20
We estimate that our water conservation efforts saved approximately 93 billion gallons of water in 2021 We also completed new projects in 2021 that we estimate will save more than 16 billion gallons annually once operational Over the last 10 years our water conserva tion efforts have saved approximately 44 billion gallons of water enough to sustain about 400000 US homes for one year2,20
During 2021 we continued to fund water restoration projects benefiting the watersheds that we impact and the communities where we operate including new proj ects in Arizona New Mexico Ireland Malaysia and India,20

Water Conservation and Restoration Below are examples of water conservation and restoration projects Intel recently implemented or funded as part of our commitment to achieve net positive water,20
We implemented ultrapure water efficiency projects in our factories by optimizing recipe flows and reducing or eliminating bypass flows After successfully piloting these reduction projects at our Ronler Acres facility in Oregon we are implementing similar projects at our other factory sites Total savings of 256 million gallons were achieved during 2021 We estimate that we will save 450 million gallons in 2022 increasing to over 700 million gallons per year by 2025,20
During 2021 we made significant progress in the operation of our onsite water reclaim facilities These innovative water treatment plants allow Intel to treat and reuse water within our operations in systems such as cooling towers and scrubbers resulting in a substan tial increase in water conservation Our Ocotillo water recycling facility in Arizona for example treated and reused approximately 11 billion gallons of water during 2021,20
An Intelsupported project aims to promote water restoration in Costa Rica through innovative forest protection schemes,20
15Mile Reach 2021 Flow Restoration Colorado Water Trust This project in the Colorado River basin which restored an estimated 226 million gallons of water in 2021 facilitates an agreement to lease water and pass additional flow downstream and through hydropower turbines to enhance flows in the 15Mile Reach The leased flows support fish and wildlife and also benefit conditions upstream on the Fryingpan and Roaring Fork Rivers As a further benefit this flow is used by a hydroelectric power plant,20

Intel and the National Parks and Wildlife Service launched a blanket bog restoration project in the Wicklow Mountains National Park This is Intels first water restoration project in Ireland,23
Wicklow Mountains National Park Blanket Bog Restoration Project National Parks and Wildlife Service Intels first water restoration project in Ireland is a pilot project that will rewet close to 150 acres of degraded peat bog to increase water storage levels by an estimated 13 million gallons each year These headwaters supply the Poulaphouca Blessington reservoir a drinking water source for the greater Dublin area The bog restoration will also protect biodiversity and improve carbon storage and is likely to improve water quality Upon completion of the pilot the resulting data will be used to evaluate a fullscale peat bog restoration effort,23
Agua Tica Forest Protection Fundecor This project which is expected to restore up to 46 million gallons of water per year aims to promote water restoration through innovative forest protection schemes in Agua Ticas action area Agua Tica is the first publicprivate water fund established in Costa Rica with the purpose of improving water quality and quantity access through a green infrastructure investment portfolio Landown ers are compensated for the environmental services of their properties and incentivized to avoid conversion of existing forests to a more degraded condition enabling activities such as natural and assisted regeneration sus tainable agricultural practices environmental education agroforestry systems and reforestation,20
Much of the waste we generate results from construction and manufacturing activities Since the mid1990s we have increased our global recycling rate of non hazardous waste from 25 to 89 even while Intels business and production continued to grow We also decreased our total waste generation by 17 between 2020 and 2021 despite increased manufacturing complexity and company growth As part of our 2030 goals we have expanded our commitment to achieve zero total waste to landfill and increased our focus on implementing circular economy strategies for our manufacturing waste streams,19
Circular Solutions for Manufacturing Waste Major semiconductor manufacturingrelated waste streams include lithographyrelated solvents metal plating waste specialty base cleaners spent sulfuric acid ammonium sulfate and calcium fluoride Our operations also generate plastic metal kitchen and general office waste,19
We continue to find ways to recover materials and regenerate resources to create circular economy solutions that reduce costs and environmental impact In 2021 we reused recovered or recycled 65 of our manufacturing waste or approximately 133000 metric tons,19
Intel is investing in segregating constituents of our spent solvent waste to enable our waste vendors to more easily refine the highvalue solvent and reintro duce it into the merchant market as a replacement raw material This will also decrease the fossil fuel combustion required for the distillation process by over 50 leading to a reduction in GHG emissions at the waste vendors facility,19
We also send sulfuric acid waste from our manufacturing operations to an offsite facility where it is processed to technical grade sulfuric acid It is then directed back to our manufacturing operations where we use it in onsite wastewater treatment systems,19
Description Achieve zero total waste to landfill and implement circular economy strategies for 60 of our manufac turing waste streams in partnership with our suppliers,19
Baseline During 2020 5 of our total waste went to landfill and we had implemented circular economy strategies for 65 of manufacturing waste,19
Progress in 2021 By the end of 2021 we maintained 5 total waste to landfill and implemented circular strategies for 65 of our manufacturing waste Our 2030 goal of 60 will be challenging in future years given our projected growth,19
and new waste streams suppliers and locations that will require new circular economy strategies,19
Looking Ahead In 2022 we plan to continue to focus on opportunities to upcycle waste by working further on waste segregation practices and collaborating with our suppliers to evaluate new technology for waste recovery and reuse,19

Our 2030 total waste definition includes hazardous waste and non hazardous solid waste as well as nonhazardous liquid waste and chemical debris In line with common waste reporting practices we do not include salts and biosolids from our onsite water reclaim facilities in Israel Oregon and Arizona,19
In 202179 of Intels manufacturing waste was fuel blended recycled reused or recovered Manufacturing waste represented 59 of our total waste in 2021 and included hazardous and nonhazardous waste associated with wafer manufacturing For our circular solutions strategy we follow the Ellen McArthur Foundation definition of circular economy and upcycling of waste Upcycling is defined as keeping products and materials in use via reuse resale repurposing and recycling It includes recovering and restoring products components and materials through strategies like reuse repair remanufacturing use as feedstock andrecycling It does not include fuel blending unless it is done after recovery of a major constituent of the waste stream,19
Product Ecology Circular Supply Chain The application of circular economy principles across the supply chain is a cornerstone of our drive to sustainability leadership Intels supply chain plays a pivotal role through the implementation of circular economy solutions for manufacturing waste upcycling extending the useful life of equipment and returned products materials reclaim and the use of postconsumer recycled materials on transportation media The consolidated efforts across the supply chain resulted in,15

Two of our 2030 RISE technology industry initiatives focus on collaborations within our ecosystem to accelerate progress on reducing climate impact in semiconductor manufacturing and advancing sustain able chemistry principles through the application of a chemical footprint methodology,13
Sustainable Manufacturing Intel is committed to contributing to the global effort toward sciencebased approaches to GHG emissions reductions in line with efforts to limit global warming to 15C However we face challenges in gaining formal approval for an emissionsreduction target under the existing methodology of the ScienceBased Targets Initiative SBTi due to a number of factors,25
First the absolute contraction approach for setting sciencebased targets does not take into account early action to reduce absolute emissions The convergence approach within SBTis sectoral decarbonization approach SDA enables consideration of early action but there is currently no SDA for the semiconductor industry,12
Second demand for semiconductors is increasing due in part to the role that technology plays in driving climate solutions Current frameworks do not include consider ation of the application of technology to reduce climate impact in global manufacturing,13
In addition emissions pathways for nonCO2 gases may differ from those for CO2 due to differences in factors such as mitigation potential Process emissions for the semiconductor manufacturing industry include non CO2 gases such as perfluorocarbons PFCs and nitrous oxide Consideration of sectorspecific differ ences in emissions pathways for CO2 and nonCO2 GHG emissions is a potential area of importance for future research and for expanding opportunities for sector specific approaches to targets,25
In 2021 we continued to work with industry stakeholders to assess the potential for the development of a sector specific approach to setting sciencebased GHG emissionsreduction targets for the semiconductor manufacturing industry The goal is to expand the number of companies in our sector setting science based targets,25
Sustainable Chemistry Sustainable chemistry is a scientific concept that seeks to improve the efficiency with which natural resources are used to meet human needs for chemical products and services Sustainable chemistry encompasses the design manufacture and use of efficient effective safe and more environmentally benign chemical products and processes Sustainable chemistry is also a process that stimulates innovation across all sectors to design and discover new chemicals production processes and product stewardship practices that will provide increased performance and value while meeting the goals of protecting and enhancing human health and the environment1,15
Our 2030 sustainable chemistry initiative is based upon the development and implementation of a chemical foot print methodology to enable quantification of a baselines against which further progress can be measured as well as to identify those chemical uses and processes for which significant improvements can be made We intend to apply the chemical footprint methodology not only to Intels direct manufacturing operations but also to integrate the methodology within the semicon ductor manufacturing supply chain both upstream and downstream of our manufacturing operations,17
In 2021 Intels Sustainable Chemistry Team continued efforts to refine the chemical footprint methodology for use in evaluation of the chemical supply chain as well as to integrate the methodology into the chemical supply chain to enable better assessment of full lifecycle impact In addition we continued to provide webinars to further the promotion of the chemical footprint meth odology as a technology industry initiative Sustainable chemistry baselines were completed for the current manufacturing technologies as well as for the year 2020 We also completed an initial analysis of current chemical uses and those identified as the highest impact chemistries have been included within a set of priority projects to further scope and disposition,17
In 2022 we plan to complete a proof of concept to enable visualization of the top impact chemical uses by mass and chemical footprint values and to identify po tential projects that will result in meaningful reductions in chemical footprint values In addition we will continue to actively participate in external chemical management initiatives geared toward the improvement of chemical management practices within our supply chain,17

As we continue to take actions to reduce Intels own global manufacturing and supply chain climate foot print and to advance product energy efficiency we have also taken on the global challenge to partner with the technology industry and other stakeholders to achieve carbon neutral computing by 2030 In addition Intel announced plans in 2022 to achieve netzero green house gas emissions in its global operations by 2040 Conceptually carbon neutral computing is achieved when the positive benefits of the ICT sector hand printthe ways in which technology is applied to reduce climate impact across the economyequals or exceeds the climate and energy footprint of productrelated emissions and carbon embedded in technology systems,13
Our global challenge framework includes partnering with others to accelerate the sustainability of PCs improve the energy efficiency of data centers and accelerate handprint projects to reduce emissions across highimpact industries such as utilities oil and gas and manufacturing,24
Collaborating on Sustainable PC Design Partnering with PC manufacturers we are assessing the carbon footprint of PCs across their life cycles to identify carbon reduction opportunities To illustrate Intel published the ATX12VO power supply specifica tion which provides higher platform power efficiency in a smaller footprint Together with Modern Standby the latest ATX12VO desktop systems will have over 40 reduction in typical energy consumption relative to an average system1 In March 2022 Intel partner MSI announced the first ATX12VO system,24
In addition Intels Project Athena Desktops take advan tage of both Modern Standby and the ATX12VO power supply unit to ensure smaller more efficient form factors designed to help OEMs meet Energy Star and EPEAT environmental responsibility standards,24
Enabling Customers to Achieve Platform Carbon Neutral Goals Based on power and performance optimization done in partnership with OEMs Intel 11th Generation Intel Core mobile processor Tiger Lakebased systems achieve 16 hours of battery life on Windows2double the eight hours of battery life in 2015,24
In addition to enhanced battery life Intel has set a new goal to lower emissions related to reference platform designs for client form factors by 30 or more by 2030 These efforts are taking shape with Dells Concept Luna prototype device developed in partnership with Intel to showcase future possibilities for sustainable PC design,24
In our efforts to reduce carbon footprint at a platform level we are also implementing technologies across the product life cycle manufacturing use and asset retirement Specifically we focus on reducing compo nent count and the area of the main board and increasing system and display energy efficiency We are also advancing the use of biobased printed circuit boards to aid in the separation of materials and components when recycling and to reduce overall electronic waste For enterprises the Intel vPro Platform enables sus tainable management throughout the entire device life cycle enabling IT organizations to reduce emissions,15

Reducing the Carbon Impact of Data Centers and the Network We have worked with our worldwide ecosystem to reduce data center carbon impact in two areas 1 Lowering energy consumption during the compute use phase which accounts for the primary source of data center carbon emissions and 2 Reducing the embodied carbon in the equipment itself in the create phase which represents roughly 1020 of emissions,24
Use phase The primary source of emissions in the use phase is from electricity used to power the data center and network One of the ways we are reducing electricity use is through AIbased telemetry which intelligently monitors and controls electricity in the data center and throughout the network Intel Xeon Scalable processors incorporate registers for monitoring cache CPU frequencies memory bandwidth and input output IO access These telemetry capabilities show the potential for significant energy savings at scale within its data center that houses 5G communication facilities Japan Telecommunications operator KDDI reduced overall electricity consumption by 20 in a trial using 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors and Intels comprehensive power management and AI capabilities,24
Create phase Intel is focusing on efforts to reduce the carbon footprint at a platform level by enabling modular component design where CPU IO and accelerator modules can be repaired or upgraded independently to extend the useful life of the platform Working alongside key data center partners we are contributing to the Open Compute Project OCP to advance modular designs establish carbon footprint metrics and set reduction goals The most recent advancements are specified in the Blue Glacier project which published a Revision 1 specification for modular design through OCP,24
Optimizing software for sustainability We work with the worlds largest cloud and communications service providers independent software vendors and open source software communities to optimize hundreds of data center and network applications to address software inefficiencies Software efficiency continues to lag hardware capabilities resulting in wasted electricity and higher carbon footprint through overprovisioning of equipment Intel introduced oneAPI to better exploit the latest hardwares cuttingedge features to unleash application performance across CPUs GPUs FPGAs and other accelerators,24
Emerging Innovation Other ways Intel is working to increase data center and network efficiency include,24
the data center air conditioning burden while enabling reuse of exhaust heat are in various stages of proofof concept and production deployment This technology can reduce cooling electricity expenses by 90 and the carbon footprint by 40 Read more about Intels pilot with Submer,21
