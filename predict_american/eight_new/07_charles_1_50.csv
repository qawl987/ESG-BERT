We approach ESG with the same focus we bring to our daytoday work creating longterm value and a shared belief in investing for the future Likewise we bring our core values of trust innovation teamwork and stewards to,3
our interactions with our broader stakeholders and to the communities we serve Our values embody how we execute our purpose and vision to be the most trusted leader in investment services and they anchor our approach to ESG,10
Our approach to ESG begins with how we regularly engage with key stakeholders in the conduct of our business to understand and meet their expectations These stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG issues and their perspective and input form the basis for our issues prioritization and the ESG framework we describe below Key stakeholders with whom we regularly engage include the following,3
Retail investors Continuous engagement with our clients is core to our business including through the use of surveys relating to trust reputation and service levels,0

This first ESG Report comes at a time of positive transition as we just passed the oneyear anniversary of the TD Ameritrade acquisition ESG assessments and priorities as well as reporting on those priorities are part of a continual process that evolves with time and focus Until there are consistent and comparable standards and definitions of ESG in the marketplace each organization must assess the relevant ESG topics to its business and stakeholders that are core to creating a sustainable and resilient business,3
As a result for this first reporting year we took a more personalized approach to engaging with a broad set of stakeholders to assess ESG issues that are relevant to Schwabs vision and the related priorities of those ESG issues In our conversations we focused on the importance of various relevant ESG factors to achieving our vision to be the most trusted leader in investment services We recognize that some ESG factors may not be as high of a priority to achieve this vision but they still have significance to certain stakeholders,3
As the ESG landscape including associated standards for measurement and disclosure becomes more defined and we continue to engage with our internal and external stakeholders we expect to grow and enhance our ESG process and reporting This first year of conducting an ESG assessment gave us valuable insights on the interconnectedness of ESG factors between various business functions and strategies As the Schwab and TD Ameritrade integration continues to move forward the ESG insights we gained during this process will allow us to refine develop and further connect and integrate ESG into our corporate strategy,3
Businessrelevant ESG indicators Informed by GRI Global Reporting Initiative standards relevant to our business and the Financial Sector standards for Asset Management Custody Activities and Commercial Banks as applicable published by the SASB Sustainability Accounting Standards Board we developed a list of indicators across environmental social governance and investment products specific to Schwab These indicators reflected in the framework on the next page were then reviewed with stakeholders for this first ESG Report,12

Assessing relative importance To identify the most relevant ESG indicators to our business and stakeholders and the relative importance of such indicators we conducted a firmwide ESG assessment We hosted numerous focus groups to conduct the ESG assessment and prioritize relevant ESG indicators identified in the framework on the previous page We also engaged in deeper oneonone conversations including with institutional owners of Schwab stock and senior management investor relations legislative affairs corporate strategy Financial Consultants Independent Branch Leaders Relationship Managers for RIAs and corporate clients the human resources team business heads and real estate and facilities Internal conversations typically reflected direct feedback from external stakeholders and provided critical insight on ESG priorities among internal and external stakeholders across our business units,3
Each focus group was asked to prioritize the importance of these indicators for Schwab to fulfill its vision as the most trusted leader in investment services within the next five years In addition we received feedback on the importance stakeholders place on these indicators in terms of Schwab and its ability to fulfill its vision,3
As the ESG reporting space matures and indicators relevant to our industry become more standardized we expect the indicators their definitions and parameters to evolve as well,18
In many ways the ESG assessment reinforced our Through Clients Eyes strategy and focus Our business is based on earning the trust of all our critical stakeholders We build trust among these stakeholders in part by managing our business with integrity and in ways that foster a sustainable and resilient business,3

While weve made progress over the past several years below are highlights of some of the actions we took in 20202021 As we share later in this report we are making investments in a sustainable future by,3
To help our clients develop a sustainable investing approach we appointed a head of ESG Strategy within Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc dba as Schwab Asset Management the asset management subsidiary of the company to guide our vision and strategy to incorporate ESG resources guidance and investment choices We have added resources and tools to include more educational pieces and access to thirdparty ESG ratings and scores Schwab Personalized Indexing a direct indexing offer will allow investors to select an ESG index and can be customized which will be a real value add particularly for selfdirected investors,3

Traditional ETFs tell the public what assets they hold each day This fund will not This may create additional risks for your investment For example,18
You may have to pay more money to trade the funds shares This fund will provide less information to traders who tend to charge more for trades when they have less information,12
The price you pay to buy fund shares on an exchange may not match the value of the funds portfolio The same is true when you sell shares These price differences may be greater for this fund compared to other ETFs because it provides less information to traders,4
These additional risks may be even greater in bad or uncertain market conditions,18
The ETF will publish on its website each day a Proxy Portfolio designed to help trading in shares of the ETF While the Proxy Portfolio includes some of the ETFs holdings it is not the ETFs actual portfolio,4
The differences between this fund and other ETFs may also have advantages By keeping certain information about the fund secret this fund may face less risk that other traders can predict or copy its investment strategy This may improve the funds performance If other traders are able to copy or predict the funds investment strategy however this may hurt the funds performance,18

Shareholder engagement and proxy voting at Schwab Asset Management,4
Historically we have taken a mostly quantitative approach to evaluating investment options and strategies reflecting the largely passiveindex orientation to our investment products In 2020 we created a team and process for company and shareholder engagement with respect to the investment assets managed by Schwab Asset Management As a fiduciary for our clients Schwab Asset Management began to engage with certain issuers that met certain criteria andor requested to engage with us on matters important to them As we move through our second year of engagement we are building learning and enhancing a process and strategy to consistently and efficiently implement effective communication with select issuers and their shareholders on both a proactive and a reactive basis,3
As ESG matters become a more dominant focus in the investment process we expect to continue to build and refine our engagement process which includes engagement both during proxy season and offseason We intend to use the engagement process to better understand concerns and align with best practices as well as to inform our discretionary voting decisions on proxy contests environmental and social disclosurerelated shareholder proposals and certain sayonpay proposals,12

Any financial support was previously and solely provided through Schwabs Political Action Committee PAC funded by voluntary contributions from our employees and directors As announced in January 2021 we discontinued the PAC and contributed the remaining funds to the Boys Girls Clubs of America and historically Black colleges and universities The PACs previous contributions are part of the public record and available on the Federal Election Commissions website,12
Relatedly we respect the right of our employees to individually participate in the political process Employees may participate in the political process or make political contributions from personal funds subject to applicable law and in accordance with our Statement on Public Policy and Political Participation,12
Advocacy Consistent with Schwabs vision and as described on our Advocacy and Ethics page we focus our advocacy efforts on policy positions that support our clients investment goals We also use our position as the leading custodian to drive awareness and support the continued growth of the independent Registered Investment Advisor RIA industry and our nearly 15000 client firms Some examples of our lobbying efforts include,12
advocated for improvements to the system by which market data is distributed to investors with the goal of leveling the playing field between the depth and quality of market information available to institutional investors and that available to individual investors Those efforts have included multiple comment letters to the SEC testifying at hearings on Capitol Hill and an ongoing education effort to help policymakers understand the differences between the cost and quality of information available to institutional and individual investors,18
Schwab has been a leader in the ongoing effort to ensure money market mutual funds remain a resilient investment option while also seeking to improve the transparency and stability of these funds As US and global regulators have made a series of changes to the rules governing money market funds Schwab has been a consistent participant submitting comment letters meeting with regulators and other policymakers and suggesting reforms that balance the needs of individual investors with the importance of ensuring the systemic stability of money market funds,18
We belonged to the following trade associations in 2020 and 2021 through our Office of Legislative and Regulatory Affairs American Bankers Association ABA American Bankers Association Securities,12

Finally we are members of a number of trade associations that are core to our business and vision Trade associations provide valuable professional education training and networking opportunities Many trade associations also engage in lobbying activities on issues of importance to the businesses they represent,12
Schwabs membership in a trade association is not an endorsement of the groups activities or positions on public policy issues Indeed Schwabs views on an issue can and do differ from that of a trade association of which we are a member In keeping with federal requirements the percentage of dues paid to trade associations that are attributable to lobbying activities must be included in the calculation of the total amount the firm spends on lobbying on a quarterly basis Based on the information reported to us by these trade associations for 2021 the aggregate amount of our dues designated by these trade associations as attributable to the company for lobbying was approximately 792000 Finally the company also now discloses that it does not make any donations or payments to 501c4 social welfare nonprofits,12
Membership in trade associations that engage in lobbying activity is reviewed annually by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors and the company regularly evaluates its participation in trade associations and industry groups weighing the costs and benefits of continued membership From time to time the company determines not to renew its membership in an organization For example the company discontinued its membership in the US Chamber of Commerce in 2021,12
