role that the financial sector can play in mobilizing the capital needed to drive progress It expands on our prior oneyear target,3
growth while helping to address key global challenges That is why we have set a target to finance and facilitate more,3
The Target reflects our recognition of the need for collective action to address the worlds most important challenges and the,10
Our Sustainable Development Target the Target aims to grow and strengthen our business activities across three,3
200 billion to support climate action and sustainable development in 2020 to a new 10year target that extends through,13
the end of 2030 which corresponds with the timeframe we set to meet our initial emission intensity reduction targets within our,21
financing portfolio see page 12 as well as the current timeframe set by the United Nations for achieving the SDGs,12
By drawing awareness to the work happening across the Firm to advance sustainable development the Target is designed to,10
mobilize our efforts and sharpen our focus on key areas that contribute towards solutions for the worlds toughest challenges,18
the actions we are taking as part of,10
The Target builds on our history of fulfilled commitments to support climate action and sustainability,13
2017 Facilitate 200 billion in clean financing by 20251,12
2020 Finance and facilitate 200 billion for climate action and sustainable development in 2020 2,13

2 Achieved in 2020 by financing over 220 billion in transactions including more than 55 billion toward green initiatives,12
In setting the Target we took into account the Firms breadth scope and geographic reach,3
In 2021 our Firm financed and facilitated approximately 285 billion towards the Target Across our three objectives 41 went towards,12
spanning the globe and encompassing activities across both our retail and wholesale business,17
development finance 37 towards green and 22 towards community development In this section we discuss our progress in each,10
segments We prioritized areas that are important to global sustainability and inclusive growth and,3
where we believe our capabilities and expertise can help drive progress We also concentrated on,3
topics that are important to our stakeholders including customers and clients employees,10
communities and shareholders This led to the Targets three areas of focus each of which combines,10
a clear need and business opportunity that we believe our Firm is well positioned to address,3
In the development of the Targets criteria and methodology we also took into account international,12
best practices and industry standards such as the SDGs the International Capital Market,12
Associations Green and Social Bond Principles and the International Finance Corporations,12
We are mobilizing resources and expertise throughout the Firm to drive progress toward our goals,3
This includes deploying both new and existing teams to enhance our capabilities and realize,3
opportunities across our wholesale and consumer business segments as well as across other,17
corporate functions For example CCBs Community and Affordable Home Lending business is,2
helping expand our support for sustainable homeownership and our growing network of,2
Community Center branches is advancing a new model for how we support diverse entrepreneurs,8
and their communities Elsewhere we are investing in resources such as CBs Green Economy and,10
Community Development Banking teams CIBs ESG Solutions team and Center for Carbon Transition,3
CCT and the JPM DFI each of which play a key role in collaborating with our global network of,12
bankers and product specialists to deliver strategic services and facilitate financing at scale,15
For the Target we have established a robust governance process designed to provide accountability,12
for how we quantify and track our progress over time This includes a crosslineofbusiness and,18
functional group responsible for approving the quantification approach documentation and,12
reporting associated with transactions that contribute toward the Target Together these actions,12

To learn more about our criteria for determining what business activity is eligible to count toward our Sustainable Development Target and,3
how we account for the value of transactions see Our Approach to Our Sustainable Development Target3,12
3 Our approach to measuring our progress for the Target builds off the criteria and methodology we developed for our 200 billion commitment in 2020 For the Target we made methodological adjustments from the 2020 commitment in two main areas 1 Development Finance driven by refinements in the JPM DFIs methodology as explained,12
in its latest annual report and 2 Community Development with the inclusion of small business and housingrelated loans and investments for Black Hispanic and Latino individuals and communities largely consistent with our Racial Equity Commitment,8
By the end of 2030 we aim to finance and facilitate 1 trillion in support of the deployment of solutions for cleaner,12
sources of energy and facilitating the transition to a lowcarbon economy Our eligible business activities include,24
renewable energy clean technology water waste management conservation sustainable transportation green,19
In 2021 we financed and facilitated approximately 106 billion in support of our green objective particularly towards,12
sustainable transportation and renewable energy We supported these areas through a variety of businesses around,24
our Firm such as underwriting green bonds for corporate and sovereign issuers capital raising and advisory services,12
for electric vehicles EV companies and lending to emerging renewable energy companies 2021 in particular was a,24

Wind project the first offshore wind farm in the United States capable of generating power at utility scale and the,24
countrys largest source of offshore wind power Situated off the coast of Marthas Vineyard the project is expected to,24
supply enough energy to serve the needs of 400000 Massachusetts households and businesses and avoid 168 million,24
metric tons of carbon emissions annually while contributing to efforts to transition the US power grid to cleaner,25
JPMorgan Chase provided services across our diversified business to support the development of Vineyard Wind We,3
provided Investment Banking services acting as Joint Lead Arranger and Syndication Agent for a senior secured,12

had multiple book runners only JPMorgan Chases participation is counted toward the Target,4
The development finance objective of the Target highlights the work of the JPM DFI which was established to spur,12
capital towards sustainable development projects such as expanded access to education financial services,2
telecommunications and health care in developing countries By assessing transactions based on their anticipated,2
environmental and socioeconomic impacts the JPM DFI seeks to expand the market for development finance and grow,10
the pool of investors interested in transactions that offer financial returns and advance the SDGs For more information,12

The JPM DFI assessed the transaction and determined it,12
advances United Nations SDGs 8 and 9 which are associated,12
with promoting decent work and building resilient infrastructure,3
7 Numbers may differ from the JPM DFIs 2021 Annual Report primarily due to overlap with some transactions advancing both the green objective and development finance,12
objective For the Target these transactions are counted only once toward the green objective,4
Our work in the Community Development area of our Target supports areas such as homeownership and affordable,10
housing small business education and health care with a focus on LMI and Black Hispanic and Latino individuals,8
In 2021 we reflected approximately 61 billion of financing and facilitation towards this objective,12
The Community Development objective also highlights our commitment to racial equity and includes many of the,8
activities we are engaging in as part of our fiveyear 30 billion Racial Equity Commitment By the end of 2021 we had,8

Climate change is one of the most critical challenges facing our planet and society We are responding by minimizing,13
the carbon footprint of our own physical operations see page 17 and by leveraging our business to support and,3
accelerate the global transition to a lowcarbon economy,3
In recent years many governments businesses and NGOs have aligned around the collective ambition to reduce,12
A key aspect of our lowcarbon strategy is how we engage with our clients in carbonintensive industries on their transition In,3
2020 we pledged to align key sectors of our financing portfolio with the goals of the Paris Agreement In May 2021 we became,12
the first large US bank to set 2030 targets which we set as portfoliolevel emissions intensity reduction targets for the Oil,21
Gas Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing sectors and published our Carbon Compass Methodology detailing our approach,12
We also announced our plans to expand our targets to new sectors of our financing portfolio over time In October 2021 we,12
joined the NZBA a group convened by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative which brings together a,12
global network of banks committed to aligning their lending and investment portfolios with net zero emissions by 2050,25
While thoughtful policy technology and behavioral advancements are all prerequisites in realizing our common goals around net,12
zero emissions by 2050 we joined the NZBA because we support the ambition for greater climate action the sharing of best,13
practices and a collaborative approach between the public and private sectors to reach this goal We may further address,12
important details of these efforts as they develop over time including where we believe practical considerations may constrain,12
our work against the ambitions of the NZBA such as the necessity of technological advancements the evolution of consumer,15
behavior the need for thoughtful climate policies around the world the challenge of balancing shortterm targets with the need,13
to facilitate an orderly and just transition and other critical considerations such as legal and regulatory obligations,12

Reducing the environmental impact of our physical operations is an important part of becoming a more sustainable,15
In 2020 we committed to achieve carbon neutrality across our operations annually This commitment includes Scope 1 direct,12
organization Our direct environmental impacts stem primarily from the operation of our more than 6000 corporate,13
GHG emissions from building operations and companyowned aircraft and vehicles Scope 2 indirect GHG emissions from,25
offices bank branches and data centers Our approach to operational sustainability consists of two key components,3
purchased electricity and Scope 3 indirect GHG emissions associated with business travel In 2021 we met our carbonneutral,25
managing our carbon footprint by reducing our direct and indirect GHG emissions and enhancing resource management,25
goal for the second year in a row using carbon offsets to help us achieve neutrality We are committed to maintaining carbon,12
and efficiency which includes responsible stewardship of water waste and other key resources across our operations,20
Creating actionable strategies for reducing our GHG footprint depends on having clear and comprehensive insight into,25
our emissions sources and performance Since 2005 we have been measuring and publishing our operational GHG,25
emissions and using that data to inform our strategies for reducing both our direct and indirect emissions as well as,25
offsetting the impact of the emissions we are not yet able to eliminate,25
Our strategy to maintain carbon neutral operations is focused on the following,3
Improving efficiency Reducing energy use is our first priority We continue to undertake a variety of energy efficiency,24
measures for example optimizing the use of heating and cooling in our buildings and to expand their implementation,24
Sourcing renewables Next we are focused on installing onsite solar systems at JPMorgan Chase properties and establishing,24
longterm renewable energy procurement agreements eg Power Purchase Agreements and green power supply contracts,24
We are working to increase the proportion being met with onsite renewable energy and offsite longterm renewable energy,24
contracts to 70 or more by 2025 In 2021 over 20 of our renewable procurement came from these solutions,12
Purchasing Energy Attribute Certificates EACs and carbon offsets To continue to meet our commitment to source,12
renewable energy for 100 of our global power needs annually and address the remainder of our direct and indirect emis,24
sions we purchase applicable EACs eg GreenE certified Renewable Energy Certificates RECs InternationalRECs and,12
JPMorgan Chases 2021 operational GHG emissions were driven by two primary activities powering,25
our buildings eg electricity heating and cooling and business travel Scope 1 GHG emissions,25
include those from building operations and companyowned aircraft and vehicles Scope 2 emissions,25
from purchased electricity are the largest driver of our buildingrelated emissions and overall,21
operational GHG footprint The majority of our business travelrelated emissions are Scope 3,25
emissions from commercially operated air and rail reimbursed personal vehicle and rental car travel,21
and hotel stays A small portion of our business travel emissions are Scope 1 emissions from,25
To build on our commitment to carbon neutral operations in 2021 we announced a new target to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2,12
locationbased emissions by 40 by 2030 versus a 2017 baseline As of the end of 2021 we had reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2,25
emissions by approximately 15 Moving forward we intend to make further progress by increasing our direct use of renewable,25
energy upgrading existing heating and cooling systems and optimizing building space Over time as we strive to reduce our,24
operational emissions through these measures we anticipate needing to buy fewer offsets to neutralize our emissions,25
On our website you can find more information related to our environmental data,22

retail branches across the US As of December 31 2021 we have added solar installations at nearly,24
300 retail branches in nine states including Arizona California Ohio and New York among others,4
Our goal is to complete solar installations at approximately 400 additional branches plus 125 car,24
ports totaling over 25 megawatts MW of solar capacity We are also expanding solar installations at,24
our corporate office buildings and expect to deploy approximately 90 MW of additional solar capacity,24
247 renewable energy In 2021 we collaborated with energy provider EDF to power our buildings in,24
the UK with renewable energy around the clock As part of this effort our electricity consumption in,24
the UK will be matched to renewable generation every minute of the day providing us with approxi,24
mately 120000 MWh of renewable electricity each year enough to power our three million square,24
feet of offices in the UK or the equivalent of about 33000 homes,7
Carbon offsets are an important tool that enable companies to support projects that reduce GHG,25
emissions and in many cases create valuable social and community cobenefits At JPMorgan Chase,10
we purchase offset credits to address emissions that we are unable to abate through efficiency,25
improvements or other measures We purchase offset credits that have been certified by accredited,12
third parties which means they are real additional and independently verified We also strive to,12
