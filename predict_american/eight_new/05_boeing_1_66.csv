Improving FirstTime Quality Cracking Down on Defects Welding is a fabrication process used to fuse together two or more parts with heat pressure or both forming a join as the parts cool When welding aluminum heat affected zone HAZ cracking can occur due to a number of variables When this happens it leads to significant rework This affects quality causing part supply and production impacts and adding cost,15
A crossfunctional team of Boeing engineers and mechanics wanted to tackle this chronic problem so they performed a robust rootcause analysis to identify all contributing factors Based on the findings they documented and implemented a new standard work and procedures process Subsequently all Boeing mechanics and welders were trained on the new procedures welding equipment was evaluated and tested to optimize machine settings and additional partcleaning measures were put in place prior to assembly to reduce the likelihood of HAZ defects,9
Thanks to this committed team HAZ cracking has been reduced by over 35 each month improving quality and efficiency and saving tens of thousands of dollars per month,24
the multiple passes and cure cycles needed with traditional paint Not only can the results be far more creative but we also will have faster turnaround times and reduced costs,4
Design Insights New Livery InkjetPrinting Process Could Offer Advantages Boeing teams from across the globe worked together to adapt inkjetprinting technology to create photorealistic airplane liveries by precisely applying billions of dots of ink to curved surfaces using a rotatable eightaxis print head,15
This new inkjet printing process takes our aircraft livery and imagedesign efforts to the next level said Chip Frohlich Director of Advanced Manufacturing for Commercial Airplanes Product Development If the customer can imagine it we will be able to deliver it from solid colors to photos Eventually we could operate it similarly to a car wash without,15
Traditionally it takes three to 12 production days to paint liveries With inkjet printing the time required for image application will be reduced to just a couple of days even for complex designs plus safety is improved by minimizing work at heights It also provides better aerodynamics in flight thanks to the elimination of paint steps and edges In addition with the reduction of up to 100 pounds 45 kilograms of weight resulting from multiple paint layers being replaced by a single thin layer of ink fuel efficiency is enhanced,15
The technology is still in development and is not yet available to customers but is showing great promise as a simpler and more environmentally preferred process,15
From a customers initial request to the creation of the aircraft or product to its use and eventual retirement every stage along the way can be engineered with Earth and all its inhabitants in mind This is Boeings lifecycle approach Design build and deliver each of its products and services with the highest standards of safety quality integrity and sustainability Digital solutions span many aspects of our product life cycle,15
Boeings product lifecycle strategy centers around creating a product with its own end of life taken into account These examples demonstrate how Boeing technology is sustaining and maintaining fleets and accelerating product lifecycle development from design to production to use all the time supporting customers efficiency needs,15

MQ25 Stingray Mission and Design Efficiency Leads the Way Efficiency is a founding principle for the MQ25 Stingray the US Navys first uncrewed aerial refueler Instead of diverting FA18 Super Hornets from their fighter mission to refuel other carrier aircraft the MQ25 with its highly efficient commercial engine and lightweight composite skins will be able to stay in the air much longer using little fuel itself to complete its mission,24
Efficiency is part of the mission but its also part of our design and production philosophy said Jim Young Boeing MQ25 Chief Engineer MQ25 is a digitally native aircraft with 3D models of every structure and system Even their performance is modeled which helps predict operations and sustainment,15
Using the models and validating them over more than 120 flighttest hours and three refueling flights has accelerated our confidence in this design and helped us identify improvements much earlier than traditional programs said Young,12
The efficiency thread continues through MQ25 production where advanced manufacturing techniques eliminate the need for drilling during aircraft assembly,15
As a result our mechanics are holding digital tablets not drills that guide the assembly process Young said Its not only safer and more ergonomic but also helps increase quality and reduce foreign object debris Its all part of supporting the Navys air wing of the future,15
Uncrewed Aircraft Manufacturing Technology Rises to Sustainability Challenge,15
Safe and sustainable manufacturing technology developed for Boeings commercial airplanes has transitioned to improving efficiency of the Airpower Teaming System ATS the first military aircraft designed developed and manufactured in Australia in over 50 years,21
Our team leverages several advanced technologies including additive manufacturing to produce the aircraft structures in the most efficient manner said Phil Crothers Affordability and Technology Integration ATS,15
Many of the resulting flyaway parts are made from composites carbonfiber reinforced plastic combined with an advanced resininfusion process which are much lighter than the more commonly used metallics thereby reducing fuel use and emissions Excess and endoflife composite material can be recycled into laptop cases car parts railcar undercarriages and other products,15
To evaluate the benefits of these measures and to uncover where we can strive further we are conducting research to address the full lifecycle impact of materials used in the aircraft said Crothers This is an essential part of our commitment to sustainability transparency,15

Managing the various blends of sustainable aviation fuel SAF for Boeings commercial operations is no easy feat for fuel truck driver Terry Garl Garl is a vital part of the Boeing Licensed Transportation fueling team that coordinates the storage and distribution of three different types of SAF at Seattles Boeing Field the 100 SAF a 5050 blend half SAF half conventional jet fuel used for the Boeing ecoDemonstrator program and a 3070 blend previously reserved for delivery flights by customer request in addition to various types of conventional jet fuel,24
When Boeing signed a deal to purchase 2 million gallons of SAF from EPIC Fuels for its commercial airplane operations for 2022 the largest announced SAF procurement by an airframer Garls job became a bit easier,24
We used to have to take our SAF deliveries and segregate them into a fuel truck said Garl Now with this large of a,24
shipment it goes straight into the fuel farms at each site So any airplane being fueled at Boeing Field could get SAF in its tank,24
By 2030 all commercial airplanes Boeing delivers will be capable to fly on 100 SAF that was the commitment we made in January 2021 Keeping that promise requires steady progress and strong partnerships Boeing is forging ahead with other stakeholders to advance this dropin replacement for conventional jet fuel,24
A key challenge of SAF is creating commercialscale production of pricecompetitive supplies Producing this level of SAF globally will require significant investment and policy changes To address these challenges Boeing announced a partnership with SkyNRG on scaling the availability and use of SAF globally including an investment in SkyNRGs SAF production project,17

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Development is a Team Sport,24
No one entity can decarbonize aviation alone so Boeing provided technical support for SAF flights with two customers on board 737 MAXs and for RollsRoyces 100 SAF flight with its 747 test bed In December several Boeing leaders boarded a United Airlines 7378 in Chicago for the firstever passenger flight on 100 SAF in one engine They flew to Washington DC on 500 gallons 1900 liters of 100 SAF in one engine and an equivalent volume of conventional jet fuel in the other,21
United continues to lead from the front when it comes to climate change action United CEO Scott Kirby said on the day of the historic flight Todays SAF flight is not only a significant milestone for efforts to decarbonize our industry but when combined with the surge in commitments to produce and purchase alternative fuels were demonstrating the scalable and impactful way companies can join together and play a role in addressing the biggest challenge of our lifetimes,13
SAF advancements in aviation can happen on the ground as well In late 2021 Boeing entered into a longterm partnership with the NASA Langley Research Center to test SAF emissions,21
The two aerospace pioneers joined forces to collect and analyze SAF emissions on the ground from the 2021 Boeing ecoDemonstrator an Alaska Airlines 7379 The testing included a flight with 100 SAF in one engine and conventional jet fuel in the other The data collected thus far is consistent with the expectations of the benefits of the renewable fuel Working with our industry partners Boeing is conducting the research not only to make our commercial airplanes 100 SAFcapable but also to better understand all aspects of SAF and how it will improve aviation sustainability,21

One of the best parts the ecoDemonstrator program is sharing the innovative work we do with others said Program Manager Rae Lutters Collaboration with industry partners is a key component of the program and Boeings strategy to decarbonize aviation Alaska Airlines was instrumental in making this years program a success,3
Alaska Airlines flies to some of the most beautiful places in the world and we care deeply about ensuring the communities lands and natural habitats where we live and fly are strong and healthy for the long haul said Diana Birkett Rakow Alaska Airlines Senior Vice President of Public Affairs Sustainability,23
Weve set a goal of achieving netzero carbon emissions by 2040 but we cant do it alone Thats why partners like Boeing and programs like the ecoDemonstrator are so critical to innovate and test new technologies and to work together to ensure theyre implemented and scalable We are grateful for Boeings visionary leadership in setting a sustainable course for aviation,25
Diana Birkett Rakow Alaska Airlines Senior Vice President of Public Affairs Sustainability,12
In 2021 20 new technologies were tested that can reduce fuel use and noise enhance safety and operational efficiency and incorporate more sustainable materials Those technologies include an acoustic lining inside the engine nacelle that reduces noise Boeing and Alaska Airlines partnered with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on sensors that measure greenhouse gas emissions Engineers conducted ground tests on a fireextinguishing agent intended to replace Halon 1301 We also tested cabin interior sidewalls made from recycled carbon composite fiber a byproduct of our own production The sidewalls can reduce noise and waste going to landfills and are lighter than the panels they replaced,21
This was the eighth airplane to serve as a flying test bed for the ecoDemonstrator program which will celebrate its 10year anniversary this year,24
Performing Under Pressure In late 2021 Boeing and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA conducted testing on a new type of large fully composite linerless cryogenic fuel tank designed and manufactured by Boeing It passed a series of burst tests at NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center validating the tanks composite materials and fabrication methods and signifying that the technology is mature ready and reliable for use in aerospace vehicles in space and in the air,15
While this particular cryotank was designed for space applications the lessons learned from this testing campaign along with our previous hydrogen demonstration flighttest programs mark an important leap in materi als technology for sustainable aviation The 30foot 9meter tank has the capacity to hold 16000 gallons 60600 liters of liquid hydrogen the energy equivalent of about 3700 gallons 14000 liters of Jet A fuel,24
which is typical of a regional jetsized airplane Using hydrogen aboard a commercial aircraft can eliminate inflight carbon emissions which has exciting potential But it also introduces a number of important engineering and lifecycle sustainability challenges that Boeing continues to actively assess Read more here,21
This cryotank designed for space has the capacity to hold,24
The future of flight will take into account the latest digital design test and production tools airframe and propulsion and systems technology Boeing is at the forefront of informing the future of aerospace and understanding how alternative power and energy solutions such as hydrogen and electrification systems will apply across market segments and missions,24
We need green hydrogen generated using electrolysis powered by renewable electricity to produce SAF Beyond using hydrogen for SAF the industry is considering using it as an energy carrier on board an aircraft Boeing has innovated with hydrogen and fuel cell applications onboard aircraft for over 15 years We have developed insights through five flight demonstration programs with crewed and uncrewed aircraft using hydrogen fuel cells and combustion engines We also have substantial experience with hydrogen and especially cryogenic storage systems from our space and launch business,24

Start with Quality to Finish with Quality Early Involvement Sets the Stage,14
The intent of EQI then and now is not to correct quality issues but to avoid them in the first place Rucker said,18
Strengthening System Drives Higher Quality in Building and Delivering Products,15
The Boeing Quality Management System QMS is an established business management system meant to ensure customer regulatory and business requirements are met In 2021 the company continued to strengthen its system through application of the One Boeing Production System and lean principles using new industry assessment tools and operating in alignment with a Safety Management System SMS QMS and SMS work together and are built into the companys organizational policies processes procedures and resources They are intended to enable teams to make a perfect copy conforming and safe every time The Boeing QMS is based on AS9100 the internationally recognized and premier aerospace QMS standard Like other major aerospace manufacturers Boeing flows down AS9100 certification and compliance requirements to its suppliers to build a quality foundation that enables effective and efficient processes that meet multiple customer regulatory and business requirements,14
The best way to achieve quality is by incorporating it into products and services from the beginning of design Quality fuels sustainability by evaluating and improving efficiency reducing waste and improving management processes,15
For years design and proposal teams in Phantom Works a Boeing organization that innovates the next generation of aerospace and defense solutions have been using Early Quality Involvement EQI methods and tools to ensure that quality is incorporated from the start This helps to identify quality issues concerns and risks that may surface and to prevent them from happening,18
With Phantom Works success teams are replicating EQI across Defense Space Security BDS BDS Total Quality is driving EQI methods and tools across BDS and integrates them into the Enterprise Standard Gated Process by which development programs are shepherded from initial concepts through deployment All BDS Total Quality employees are asked to take a 10minute trainer on EQI,18
The EQI Toolset lays out a series of checklists and templates for program managers and others to follow as they pass through the first stages of newproduct development helping them identify crucial issues that could crop up and plan ahead for them said Clark Rucker Manager of BDS Integrated Quality Rucker served on the Phantom Works Quality team when EQI was designed,18

When I put safety and quality first I enable performance,9
I am responsible for the quality of my work,10
Each teammates contributions to highquality performance directly relate to the safety and quality of all products and services Boeing delivers,14
Getting it Right the First Time Safe and Clean,15
The Boeing Production System BPS is the framework by which Boeing uses standards and problem solving to continually improve its production system The goal is zero safety incidents zero foreign object debris FOD and 100 firstpass quality Teammates can expect a safe place to work the right tools training and materials timely feedback and recognition and ways to raise concerns and get the help they need,9
By learning adopting and maturing the BPS standards across our global enterprise we foster the predictability and discipline neces sary to operate with excellence and deliver results with firsttime quality As we apply lean principles and take steps to eliminate waste in every aspect of our business we need to determine not only how to solve the problems that arise but also how to prevent them from happening again,0
BPS contributes to sustainability by improving efficiency reducing waste and improving management processes,19

Climate risks and opportunities inform our path toward sustainable aviation both in our products and in how we build them More information including identification of risks and opportunities and discussion of the mechanisms Boeing uses to manage risks and realize opportunities is included in our annual CDP formerly Climate Disclosure Project report Information about oversight assessment and management of climaterelated risks and opportunities is provided on Page 15 of this report,13
To achieve our goals related to the climate and to greenhouse gases GHG we actively monitor emissions fuel use and energy efficiency We have set targets for performance in each of these areas As part of Boeings robust business continuity program we also monitor the length and severity of business interruptions The scope of monitoring includes damaging weather natural disasters pandemics and public health crises It helps us understand how to increase resiliency in light of a changing climate,25
Boeing achieved netzero carbon emissions at manufacturing and other facilities and in business travel in 2021 for the second consecutive year by expanding conservation and renewable energy use while securing verified offsets for the remaining greenhouse gas emissions,25
Since 2008 Boeing has voluntarily and transparently reported greenhouse gas emissions from our operations in annual CDP disclosures In 2021 CDP awarded Boeing a climate change grade of B C for water security,25
Boeings greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy is managed within the Global Enterprise Sustainability organization The management team tracks performance procures energy and initiates energy and emissions reduction projects across the company This organization is well positioned to set strategic goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and energy conservation and to play an active role in achieving these goals,25
Boeing achieved netzero carbon emissions at manufacturing and other facilities and in business travel in 2021 for the second consecutive year Boeing photo,25
Enterprise greenhouse gas emissions from operations are calculated after the conclusion of the reporting year However the emissions from natural gas and electricity usage at Core Metric Sites are calculated and monitored on a monthly basis through the use of utility bills and are continuously validated and updated throughout the reporting year The emissions factors for these energy sources are validated at least annually and updated when appropriate following guidance from the World Resources Institute GHG Protocol The energy data and emissions factors are verified as part of a third party limited assurance process,25
In 2021 we maintained manufacturing and other facilities netzero emissions specifically Boeingcontrolled emissions and business travel The company is continuously increasing renewable energy use conserving resources and using carefully selected offsets to sustain this achievement,24
Boeing chooses offsets that meet rigorous requirements set by Verified Carbon Standard VCS American Carbon Registry or Gold Standard Many projects leverage the power of nature and are designed for the protection and restoration of forests Boeing looks for cobenefits or the positive effects that a policy or measure aimed at one objective might have on other objectives For example forest health may be the main objective and while other benefits extend to supporting local communities and protecting biodiversity,23
Since 2020 Boeing has been an official partner of the Aviation Carbon Exchange ACE a partnership between the International Air Transport Association IATA and XCHG company CBL Markets ACE is a centralized marketplace for airlines and other stakeholders to buy offsets eligible for the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation CORSIA,12

Sustainable Fix Keeps 52 Miles of Nylon Out of Landfill,19
At the Boeing EnCore Interiors BEI facility in Seal Beach California technicians noticed a sticky situation on the shop floor During 737 floor panel fabrication the doublesided tape used to create a vacuum seal during curing was difficult to work with and damaging tooling,9
The materials used in the process were also single use so over 11000 rolls of tape and 52 miles 84 kilometers of nylon were making their way to the landfill each year,19
We knew we needed to find a solution that was better for our tooling and the environment said David Brink General Manager of the facility,12
Alongside Boeing Research Technology the BEI team researched tested and implemented a new design with a reusable silicone bag and nonadhesive zipper seal that doesnt damage tooling,15
The sustainable solution keeps 87 tons 79 tonnes of waste out of the landfill and saves an estimated 175000 annually in material costs There are also ergonomic benefits as technicians no longer have to peel the doublesided tape off the tooling,19
Oftentimes a new project improves one area at the sacrifice of another for the greater good Brink said Implementing the reusable bag was a win on all fronts financially ergonomically and environmentally,15
BEI is a Boeing subsidiary that supplies cabin products for new production and retrofit on Boeing and nonBoeing airplanes,15
