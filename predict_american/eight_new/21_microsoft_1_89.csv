Microsofts sustainability commitments two years into our tenyear journey,3
By Brad Smith President and Vice Chair and Dr Lucas Joppa Chief Environmental Officer,12
As we look towards 2030 the world will need all the ingenuity it can muster Because as significant as COVID19 is its not the only challenge our world faces Climate change presents environmental social and economic crises on a whole new level For nearly two millennia humans have been carbonizing our planet and we need to act together to decarbonize,13
Our first annual sustainability report released in January 2021 showed early progress on our commitments to become a carbon negative water positive zero waste company by 2030 and protect ecosystems by building a Planetary Computer,19
2021 was a year of both successes and challenges While we continued to make progress on several of our goals with an overall reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions our Scope 3 emissions increased year over year due in substantial part to significant global datacenter expansions and the growth in Xbox sales and usage as a result of the pandemic,25
A closer look at 2021 During our most recent fiscal year we grew business revenue by 20 percent while continuing to reduce our operational emissions as represented by Scope 1 and 2 combined with a decrease of approximately 17 percent through our purchasing of renewable energy,24
We work to limit these emissions when we design and manufacture our products and work with our suppliers to report and reduce their emissionsbut still saw an increase This serves as an important reminder that Scope 3 emissions are the most difficult to control and reduce This year has highlighted the challenges of reducing Scope 3 emissions and were committed to sharing our learnings to help other organizations who are wrestling with these same challenges,25
One Scope 3 category that saw an annual increase was capital equipment This category includes the emissions to produce equipment we bought this year and will use for a long time as well as the carbon emissions associated with the construction of new buildings including both datacenters and office space For example as the Microsoft Cloud business expands construction of new datacenters and new server equipment is needed to support growing customer demand The emissions associated with the capital equipment category accounted for about 30 percent of our Scope 3 total this year,25
Another Scope 3 category that saw an increase was the use of our products specifically the estimated emissions associated with powering products we sold including Xbox and Surface devices This category accounted for about 29 percent of our Scope 3 total this year,15
However as our business has grown and weve seen increased use of our devices and cloud services our total Scope 3 emissions comprising the companys entire value chain have increased by about 23 percent yearoveryear These emissions include among other things the carbon emitted from electricity generation to power devices at home or at work and for producing the concrete and steel we use in construction,21
Around the world the electricity used to power devices today largely comes from grids reliant on carbon intensive sources such as coal or gas so Microsoft must account for that carbon for the lifetime of our devices to accurately track our Scope 3 emissions And because every part of the world has a different mix of electricity generation sources we calculate a devices climate impact based on where the device was sold,13
The journey to net zero Despite these Scope 3 increases we remain dedicated to building a world better than the one we found and to helping our customers and partners achieve the same The impact of this work will not all be felt immediately and our experience this year highlights a few takeaways relevant to many organizations executing against their sustainability commitments,3
1 Progress wont always be linear The rate at which,4
we can implement emissions reductions is dependent on many factors that can fluctuate over time ranging from our own business growth and supplier mix to the rate of growth of green infrastructure such as the supply of and transition speed to renewable energy Additionally different sources of emissions will be addressed on different time frames as climate technologies and renewable alternatives advance And as measurement methodologies improve and new standards emerge companies like ours may see emissions rise or fall yearoveryear,25
Nonetheless the challenge remains we must continuously improve on our efforts to decouple our emissions from our growth until we reach our carbon negative commitment in 2030 Some of this will happen through the completion of specific goals such as our shift to a 100 percent electric campus vehicle fleet our move away from diesel fuel as a backup energy source for our datacenters and the carbon benefits of our waste reduction improvements due to our expanding fleet of Circular Centers Other progress will happen through the expansion of our renewable energy purchasing program to cover the energy consumption of our consumer devices through advances by our suppliers in reducing their own emissions and through increased purchasing of new materials as they enter the markets including green steel low carbon concrete and other infrastructure components of a future net zero carbon economy,24
2 Progress relies on us all counting carbon,4
consistently There are several external factors or bugs in the worlds net zero carbon program that if addressed will help us all make greater progress toward our net zero goals The world lacks a common meaning of the term net zero and a common unit of measurement for assessing the climate impact of various net zero approaches and we must all focus on maturing the markets needed to achieve a net zero carbon economy by 2050 We explored these topics in greater detail through the lens of our work on carbon removal,13
We will continue to innovate and invest to meet our ambitious commitments and well do so in a principled way We will also continue to be transparent about our progress our challenges and our learnings to help others on their journey As we look to the future we are committed to,3
Counting everything including challenging Scope 3 emissions We are putting programs in place to help lower them from working with our suppliers to help them decarbonize to continuing to innovate with our companywide internal carbon tax to incentivize emissions reduction and continuing to invest in carbon removal,25
Only investing in carbon removal offsets instead of,12
traditional avoided emissions offsets because removal is an underdeveloped and critical tool to solve the worlds climate challenge You can only get to net zero when youve reduced all that you can and your remaining carbon emissions are completely balanced by longterm carbon removal Last year we made the worlds largest purchase of carbon removal at 14 million metric tons and in this fiscal year we are on track to top that by procuring 15 million metric tons,25
From pledges to progress While 2021 presented us with some new learnings weve also made some great progress that we share in more detail in this report A few examples that illuminate the diversity of our work include the following,3
Four datacenters are Zero Waste certified with new certifications for the San Antonio Texas and Quincy Washington datacenters and renewed certifications for our Boydton Virginia and Dublin Ireland locations,19
to provide comprehensive integrated and automated sustainability management for organizations at any stage of the sustainability journey,3
Fund were helping LanzaJet complete their sustainable fuels plant in Georgiaa move that will help decarbonize our datacenters as well as the airline industry,24
While overall device emissions grew because of higher,21
sales and usage we reduced the carbon footprint for several of our products Surface Pro 8 is one of the most energy efficient Surface Pros ever and we introduced Energy Saver a new lowpower standby mode for Xbox consoles,24
We granted 100 million to Breakthrough Energy Catalyst to accelerate the development of climate solutions the world needs to reach netzero across four key areas direct air capture green hydrogen long duration energy storage and sustainable aviation fuel,24
We are committed to becoming a carbon negative water positive zero waste company by 2030,19
With net zero becoming the new normalmore than 1500 companies with total net revenue of 114 trillion have pledged that they will become carbon neutral or net zerothe world must move from climate pledges to climate progress,13
a net zero environmentally sustainable future And while the shape of what the future holds is unknown we will continue to build the foundations needed today and do the work that needs to be done to deliver on our commitments,15

Scale strategy to achieve ambitions by using the whole of the business,3
Take steps to accelerate markets ecosystems and global progress,3
Make it central to the business while making it relevant at business group levels,3
Hold everyone accountable for progress and a governance structure to track progress in real time,12
Microsofts commitments to become carbon negative water positive and zero waste by 2030 while building a Planetary Computer are well known To guide the progress across the company on those goals we have changed the way our sustainability strategy and accountabilities are set and how progress is evaluated In the interest of transparency and also to help other organizations get started we are sharing how we work first prior to our commitments and progress on themsustainable digital transformations require both strategic frameworks and cultural buyin to be successful,19
Set ambitions based on the science The best available science and policy indicate that every organization needs to do even more in far less time than previously thought As we saw the science in 2019 it was clear that our carbon neutral goal was not what the world neededthe world needs to reach net zero by or before 2050 That meant we needed to set goals aligned to the science and language of the science and we needed to be more ambitious In 2020 we made a series of environmental sustainability commitments including being carbon negative water positive and zero waste by 2030,12
Scale strategy to achieve ambitions by using the whole of the business At Microsoft we think about the positions of influence that we can use We start by taking accountability for our operations as a company but we expand this significantly as we think about the different roles that we play as a customer supplier investor employer policy advocate and partner in innovation to customers organizations and institutions around the world The challenge is to find where our organization can have the most impact across our positions of influence,4
Microsoft looked at our commitments based on our operational footprint across carbon water waste and ecosystems the technology that we provide to our customers and partners to power their sustainability initiatives and larger influence that we can have on the world with research investments strategic partnerships and policy and advocacy,12
Set the tone from the top Sustainability is no longer just a corporate social responsibility CSR function or a way to mitigate riskit must be mainstreamed into every part of the business That starts with making sustainability part of the brand commitment and embraced by all leaders At the heart of our culture is the understanding that for Microsoft to do well we need the world to do well and that we are a company that pursues profit by solving the problems of people and the planet This belief is deeply held by the leadership of Microsoftthe CEO CFO and Presidentthe entire company sees the commitment and it sets the tone across the company that sustainability is at the core of our business,10
Make it central to the business while making it relevant at business group levels Corporate commitments give your company a north star but you need to embed the strategy and build operational commitments across your business At Microsoft we knew we needed a way to implement and execute on our strategy across the entire company in every business group For each focus area carbon water waste and ecosystems we set commitments in each business group and developed roadmaps to reach these commitments We are also committed to enabling our suppliers with capacitybuilding tools and resources as well as sustainable supply chain financing,17
Our 1 billion Climate Innovation Fund is investing in organizations across our areas of commitment to build a larger more robust ecosystem of effective companies and solutions Our sponsorship at COP26 and numerous engagements with governments at the city regional state and national levels are aimed at creating policy environments that further accelerate the impact of this work and the transition to net zero,13
Report on everything not just progress Transparency is both embedded in each step and a specific commitment In this report as well as other white papers methodology papers and speaking engagements Microsoft is committed to sharing our learnings with the world When things go well we will share that as well as the playbooks to follow to achieve similar results outside our organization And if things go less well we will share that too so we can all learn and grow together We are also delivering innovative technology and services to help our customers and partners power environmental sustainability And we go beyond that with our biggest bets in policy investment catalytic partnerships and research and development,0
Hold everyone accountable for progress and a governance structure to track progress in real time Governance and accountability are critical to ensuring alignment and prioritization across your business At Microsoft we hold our business groups accountable for their carbon emissions via an internal carbon fee of 15 per metric ton In January 2021 we expanded the carbon fee so that it includes Scope 3 emissions from our supply and value chain in addition to Scope 1 and Scope 2 We set measurements and scorecards for each business groups sustainability commitments across the company and review progress twice a year We have established a Climate Council that includes senior business leaders from every business group to provide sustainability advice collaborate drive alignment prioritize resources and funding and review progress on our commitments We also tie a portion of our executive incentive plan to our carbon reduction goals,12
Take steps to accelerate markets ecosystems and global progress If the world is going to meet net zero goals by 2050 companies need to use their entire ecosystem and all of their positions of influence In addition to taking accountability for our operational footprint across carbon water waste and ecosystems Microsoft is deploying capital supporting innovation and advocating for larger policy change We led the largest corporate carbon removal RFP last year spending our dollars to drive the carbon removal market forward and to address our own needs,3
Sustainable digital transformations require both strategic frameworks and cultural buyin to be successful,3
We recognize that our employees are the most important asset and resource in advancing innovation in sustainability and are creating opportunities for them to contribute to our efforts,8
Empowering our global workforce is the center of our sustainability strategy,8
At Microsoft empowering our global workforce is the center of our sustainability strategy Both Microsoft and LinkedIn have employee communities who drive bottomup sustainability initiatives to educate inspire and activate every employee to advance the companys sustainability goals The Microsoft Sustainability Connected Community is an employeeled group of 5000 members and 32 regional chapters whose mission is to make sustainability part of everybodys job The LinkedIn Go Green sustainability engagement program includes one out of every eight employees and its 26 chapters are focused on empowering employees to take green action at home in the office and in their communities Both groups engage employees on our sustainability commitments while using Microsoft and LinkedIn technology to innovate realworld solutions to the climate crisis through the following activities,13
Ecochallenges Microsoft and LinkedIn employees participated in virtual Ecochallenges for three weeks around Earth Day 2021 to gamify personal sustainability Seven thousand people prepared 31000 meatless or vegan meals saved 197000 pounds of CO2 diverted 227000 plastic containers and bottles from landfill saved 392000 gallons of water and spent 239000 minutes learning about sustainability,6
Run an ecochallenge to give your employees the opportunity to learn and practice habits that support them on their personal sustainability journey,15
Hack for sustainability Microsoft employees selforganize into working groups all year long and hack for sustainability by partnering with each other to create innovative solutions to real world environmental challenges In 2020 Microsoft had 125 projects with 879 participants and 93 percent of participants indicated their interest in continuing the work beyond the Hackathon One awardwinning project from the Microsoft Global Hackathon Soil as a Service created a way to lower the cost of measuring organic carbon in soil using a sensor hooked up to Microsoft Azure IoT This innovative solution lowers the cost of measurement significantly incentivizing farmers to change their land management practices and helping nascent carbon marketplaces to quantify their impact The project has been picked up by a business group for further research and exploration,23
Ongoing sustainability ideating and hacking The Microsoft Garage provides a platform for hackathons and ideathons all year long including our monthlong Sustainability Ideathon for Earth Day 2021 and the yearround Sustainability program using our HackBox platform for employees to collect ideas share concepts create projects form teams and inspire colleagues globally to participate in Microsofts sustainability journey,3
Employeeled sustainability projects Employees from every facet of Microsoft and LinkedIn are empowered to lead collaborative crosscompany sustainability projects at any time This year our platform has facilitated 200 projects from more than 1000 employee hackers with projects ranging from digital foresting to smart bird feeders to building software that will help retrofit the worlds coal power plant fleet with modular nuclear reactors,9
3000 employees completed Sustainability in Action training within the first two months,10
Employeeled education In April 2021 to celebrate the 51st anniversary of Earth Day the Microsoft Sustainability Community organized three days of learning sessions to educate inspire and activate employees on the importance of sustainability Volunteers coordinated more than 40 sessions and generated 30 hours of evergreen,10
learning content covering topics from green software engineering to how to live a zero waste lifestyle at home More than 3600 people from 56 countries participated LinkedIn celebrated Earth Day with over 61 global experiences and participation from nearly 2900 employees at the virtual events,19
Our employee communities drive bottomup sustainability initiatives to educate inspire and activate employees,10
Sustainable disposition of IT assets The Sustainability Community not only helps Microsoft lower its own operational carbon and waste footprint but also creates a way to share these best practices with external organizations so they can do the same A Microsoft employee noticed a gap in our internal processes as customers migrate from onpremises IT assets to the cloud Azure the onpremises hardware like servers and racks becomes ewaste which can create serious environmental hazards if its not properly disposed of The issue was raised to the Azure leadership through the community and a new resource was developed to guide customers on how to ensure the sustainable secure and compliant disposition of IT assets This guide is being used by our Azure Migrate Modernize Program AMMP customers through which 20000 virtual machines and 2000 databases have been migrated,15
Learn more about the IT Asset Disposition Guide,12
Sustainability training In October 2021 we launched the Sustainability in Action badge This is the first allemployee learning course focused on sustainability with four hours of content on carbon water waste and ecosystems Within the first two months more than 3000 employees completed the course and can serve as sustainability champions in their daily work as well as personal lives,15

Layers of increasing impact We think about Microsofts approach to sustainability in layers of increasing impact and have structured this report accordingly in chapters across our commitments in carbon water waste and ecosystems Each chapter follows this approach as outlined here and on the following page,23
Operations We start with taking accountability for our own operational footprint which is relatively small For example we account for less than 03 percent of carbon emissions globally,25
Transformation We then look at how Microsoft technology can help our customers and partners power their environmental sustainability,15
Systems change We also look at Microsofts biggest bets in policy investments catalytic partnerships and research and development,12

A recap of key trends weve observed this year whats coming next for Microsoft and resources for organizations on their sustainability journeys,3
In each building at every campus and datacenter sustainability is a key priority for Microsoft across all phases of a project from site selection to design and construction to operations and decommissioning,15
Sustainability in our devices means looking at the impact that we have on our planet as we design manufacture and ship our devices software games and operating systems as well as product usage and end of life,15
Our operational commitments extend into our supply chain We work with our suppliers to report their emissions design plans and new approaches to reduce their emissions and track progress over time,17
Reducing Scope 1 2 emissions see page 21,25
EcosystemsTaking responsibility for our land footprint see page 81,23
The key to addressing climate change at a company like Microsoft is to partner with every industry to understand how it functions discern the elements vital to its success share and adapt solutions and help our customers chart an informed path to decarbonization,13
The context The consequences of climate change are increasingly apparent from wildfires to devastating flooding The scientific reality of climate change is more accepted than ever beforeto avert the worst effects of the rapidly changing climate the world needs to transition to a net zero carbon emissions economy by 2050 But we still lack key strategies to avoid catastrophic climate change,13
The world needs agreement on the meaning of global net zero emissions measurement to track our progress toward net zero and mature markets for carbon reduction and removal that are necessary to get us there Through our operations technology and advocacy Microsoft is addressing these three areas to help drive the change that society needs,25
Our strategy to reach carbon negative by 2030 is relatively simplewe will reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero by improving efficiency adopting new solutions and purchasing zero carbon energy1 We are engaging suppliers and our business groups to cut our Scope 3 emissions by more than 50 percent and well rely on carbon removal to reach carbon negative,25
This year we took strides forward on zero carbon energy continued progress on carbon removal and improved our methodologies and measurement of emissions data across the company We will continue to further refine how we measure and approach these categories as we move forward We also took new steps to accelerate the work of others via the launch of a new solution the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability to help our customers measure their carbon emissions more effectively and created resources to help decarbonize our supply chain,25
Our commitment carbon negative by 2030 and by 2050 to remove from the atmosphere an equivalent amount of all the carbon dioxide our company has emitted either directly or by our electricity consumption since we were founded in 1975,25
Reducing direct emissions We will reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero by the middle of the decade through energy efficiency work and reaching 100 percent renewable energy by 2025,24
Empowering customers and partners We will help our suppliers customers and partners around the world to reduce their carbon footprints through our learnings and with the power of data AI and digital technology,24
Replacing with 1001000 carbon free energy By 2030 100 percent of our electricity consumption will be matched by zero carbon energy purchases 100 percent of the time,24
Using our voice on carbonrelated public policy issues We will support new public policy initiatives to accelerate carbon reduction and removal opportunities,12
Reducing value chain emissions By 2030 we will reduce our Scope 3 emissions by more than half from a 2020 baseline,25
Investing in the future We have created a 1 billion Climate Innovation Fund to accelerate the global development of carbon reduction and removal technologies as well as related climate solutions to reduce water and waste,13
Removing the rest of our emissions By 2030 Microsoft will remove more carbon than it emits By 2050 well remove an equivalent amount of carbon to all our historical emissions,25
Our progress Reduced Scope 1 and 2 by 169,12
We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 market based emissions by 58654 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents mtCO2 in FY21 Scope 3 emissions increased by 227 percent,25
In FY21 we signed new power purchase agreements PPAs for approximately 58 gigawatts GW of renewable energy across 10 countries around the globe totaling more than 8 GW of renewable energy via PPAs or longterm contracts,24
We released a set of indepth capacity building tools and resources developed in partnership with ENGIE Impact WSP and CDP to help companies especially our suppliers report their greenhouse gas GHG emissions and set strategies to reduce emissions from electricity,25
In July 2021 87 percent of our inscope suppliers reported their emissions to CDP up 12 percent from 2020 This data informs suppliers baselines for reduction targets and gives Microsoft a more accurate picture of its Scope 3 emissions Following the CDP cycle Microsoft built out action plans with suppliers to assess and report emission reductions through 2030,21
In July 2021 we launched the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability to provide comprehensive integrated and automated sustainability management for organizations at any stage of the sustainability journey,15
In FY21 and FY22 Microsoft successfully contracted to remove 25 million mtCO2 meeting our cumulative twoyear goal This includes 14 million mtCO2 in FY21 and 11 million mtCO2 contracted to date in FY22 on path to meet our goal of 15 million mtCO2 in FY22,25
Allocated 471 million to date via our Climate Innovation Fund to accelerate our carbon goals as well as water and waste We also donated 100 million to Breakthrough Energys Catalyst initiative,13
While overall device and console use phase emissions grew as a result of higher sales and usage during the pandemic we reduced the carbon footprint for several products and usage scenarios,15
Surface Pro 8 is one of the most energy,24
30 percent smaller carbon footprint than its predecessor the Surface Book 3 133,25
lowpower standby mode for Xbox consoles uses as little as 05W,24
A year of progress and impact to get to carbon negative by 2030,13
Tracking our yearly progress toward carbon negative by 2030 In FY21 we procured the removal of 14 million metric tons of carbon as one of our initial steps towards achieving our 2030 commitment,25
Tracking our yearly emissions across Scopes 1 2 and 3 In FY21 we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 marketbased emissions by 169 percent We saw an increase in Scope 3 emissions driven by growth of our cloud services business and an increase in sales and usage of our devices,25

Carbon negative by 2030 A company is carbon negative when it removes more carbon than it emits each year,25
a Chart has been updated to reflect latest actual values which incorporate latest methodology and structural change,12
adjustments A portion of the 14 million metric tons of removal will apply to future years,19
b Overall increase in emissions is driven mainly by the growth of our cloud services business and an increase in sales,3
a Scope 2 and 3 values are marketbased,4
In FY21 we signed new PPAs for approximately 58 GW of renewable energy across 10 countries around the globe totaling more than 8 GW of renewable energy via PPAs or longterm contracts,24
Breaking down of our FY21 Scope 3 emissions by source Scope 3 represents the majority of Microsofts emissions and we are committed to reducing these emissions by more than 50 percent by 2030 Tracking and reporting against this category of emissions is critical for net zero progress,25
See appendix for more data on our carbon emissions,25
a Scope 2 and 3 values are marketbased b Overall increase in emissions is driven mainly by the growth in the categories of purchased goods and services capital goods and use of sold products,15
It is critical that companies take a rigorous approach to achieving net zero This begins with recording and reporting emissions with better data collection and automation reducing emissions as much as possible replacing electricity consumption with renewables and removing the remaining emissions,21
In January 2020 Microsoft announced its intention to be carbon negative which will see us cut our greenhouse gas GHG emissions across our operations to nearly zero and by over half by 2030 across our value chain with improvements in energy efficiency replacing with renewable energy for Scope 2 and removing the remainder of emissions We will also remove the equivalent amount of our historical carbon emissions by 2050,25
Implementing these commitments is a journey At Microsoft we have come to see this as a 5R Journey that begins with recording and reporting emissions with better data collection and automation then reducing as much as possible with that datainformed roadmap first then replacing fossil fuels in our electricity consumption with renewables and finally removing what remains,24
Our total company emissions marketbased in 2021 were approximately 14 million mtCO2 Of this total about 120000 mtCO2 were Scope 1 emissions at Microsoft datacenters and campuses Taking into account our renewable energy purchases our Scope 2 emissions were approximately 160000 mtCO2 The bulk of our emissionsmore than 97 percentare in Scope 3 which includes emissions from our supply chain the lifecycle of our hardware products and devices travel and other indirect sources,24
While our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased this year we did see an increase in Scope 3 emissions driven mainly by the growth of our cloud services business and an increase in sales and usage of our devices,25
We are committed to cutting our GHG emissions by over half by 2030 across our value chain removing the residual emissions and removing the equivalent amount of our historical carbon emissions by 2050,25
It is critical that companies take a rigorous approach to achieving net zero We have come to see this as a 5R Journey,12
Reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions across our operations In each building at every campus and datacenter sustainability is a key priority for Microsoft across all phases of a projectfrom site selection to design and construction to operations and decommissioning By the middle of the decade we are committed to reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero,25
Reducing carbon emissions with efficiency solutions Ensuring our campuses and datacenters are energy efficient is a key first step in reducing our emissions We are changing the way we build and operate facilities using allelectric efficient system designs like the use of geothermal energy and thermal energy recovery and improving the efficiency of our cloud,24
Scope 1 Direct emissions created by your activities,25
Examples include the exhaust that comes from the vehicles on your campus natural gas that your buildings directly consume and the generators you might run,21
Scope 2 Indirect emissions from the consumption of the electricity or heat you use,24
Examples include energy sources that power your office buildings or your home,24
Scope 3 Indirect emissions from all other activities in which youre engaged,25
This is by far the largest category of emissions and covers all parts of your value chain upstream and downstream Upstream examples include supply chain materials in buildings business travel and manufacturing Downstream examples include the electricity customers consume using your products,15
Scope 3 measurement poses a significant opportunity for improvement,12
We are pursuing Zero Carbon certification for our Silicon Valley campus and Redmond campus modernization project with International Living Futures Institute We have committed to certifying our Microsoft datacenters and major offices to LEED Gold or Platinumwith a focus on the categories of energy and atmosphere water efficiency materials and waste location and transportation sustainable sites and indoor environmental conditions Four of our datacenters are LEED Gold certified and 74 projects are going through certification,24
Microsoft is using Bonsai a lowcode AI platform that is part of the Autonomous Systems suite from Microsoft to improve the efficiency of its Redmond campus chiller plants These chiller plants provide the air conditioning within an HVAC system and typically represent a substantial portion of the energy footprint of buildings We have seen a 12 percent increase in median efficiency based on energy estimates and plan to implement Bonsai in the 12 remaining chiller plants this fiscal year In the past energy conservation measures ECM projects took more than 12 months Bonsai enabled us to build a model and test recommendations in two to four weeks with comparable results,24
All future datacenters will be LEED Gold certified with emphasis on water and energy conservation All lighting is highefficiency LED with motion detection to minimize use of space light Cooling systems are integrated with the servers providing cooling only when the servers require it,24
Avoiding emissions with kinetic energy for backup power,24
At the Bengaluru Cosmo office site we installed an uninterruptible power supply UPS with flywheel to store kinetic energy to provide backup power without the need for lead acid batteries typically used in conventional UPS The UPS flywheel has the additional benefit of avoiding thousands of metric tons of carbon emissions over its 20year lifecycle and avoiding 1500 lead acid batteries treated as hazardous waste at endoflife,19
Increasing carbon awareness and lowering carbon in cloud operations,25
We are piloting new approaches that lower the carbon footprint of our code as well as largescale workloads for Microsoft and our customers benefit We piloted a new feature called StartStop VMs which can automatically turn off VMs during idle hours Our engineers have also created more transparency inside Azure Machine Learning displaying resource metrics including GPU energy utilization and computational cost to help data practitioners assess and mitigate the hidden costs of their machine learning workloads and partnered with the Allen Institute for AI to develop a set of best practices and tools in this space We developed the Carbon Aware Core which helps schedule workloads in times and regions with the lowest carbon footprint which is being piloted by Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Research and will be provided as an opensource toolkit through the Green Software Foundation Engineers are also testing and deploying novel approaches like Kubernetes Scheduler to take advantage of gridlevel fluctuations in carbon intensity to minimize carbon,24
Transitioning to 100 percent renewable energy By 2025 we expect to power our datacenters and facilities with 100 percent additional new renewable energy generation that matches our electricity consumption on an annual basis,24
Already weve contracted for more than 8 GW of renewable energy In addition to these purchases were using our campuses as living laboratories for energy innovation,24
See our full approach to renewable energy on the next page,24
We have installed onsite renewables at select campuses as well At our Silicon Valley campus a solar panel system will offset energy consumption up to 15 percent Our Beijing and Shanghai Zizhu campuses have made similar efforts installing photovoltaic PV solar panels on empty roof space in FY20 which are expected to generate 15450 MWh of electricity over the next 25 years to power the campus LinkedIns new campus in Omaha features an onsite solar array over the parking structure The system has an estimated annual output of approximately 750000 kWhyear of electricity equivalent to about 15 percent of all site energy usage and is being integrated with onsite battery storage to help reduce peak demand and address any intermittent excess solar generation produced by the array,24
Harnessing thermal energy to halve energy consumption on campus,24
In 2021 we unveiled our plans for a new hyperefficient thermal energy center for our Puget Sound campus which utilizes geothermal wells to heat and cool our buildingsresulting in a 50 percent reduction in energy usage compared to the typical utility plant In our Silicon Valley campus thermal energy storage tanks will support the closed loop water system that provides all heating and cooling needs for the campus,24
Removing fossil fuels from our campuses and datacenters We are leaving no stones unturned in our quest to reach net zero We are eliminating our dependency on diesel fuel at our datacenters electrifying our campus fleet and moving to all electric kitchens,24
Cloud providers around the world rely on dieselpowered generators for backup power to support continuous datacenter operations Microsoft has committed to be dieselfree by 2030 Innovations include the following,24
Renewable fuels Our datacenter region in Sweden will be one of Microsofts first sites to use lowercarbon renewable fuel for backup power The datacenters generators run on Preem Evolution Diesel Plus the worlds first Nordic Ecolabelled fuel which contains at least 50 percent renewable raw material and nearly an equivalent reduction in net carbon dioxide emissions compared with standard fossil diesel blends This solution is being expanded to other datacenters across the world with other suppliers,24
Batteries as backup power We are assessing the longterm feasibility of deploying large batteries as backup power for critical infrastructure via our strategic collaboration with TOTAL and are continuing research and development in this area We are also implementing an extended battery solution for datacenters that operate on highly reliable grids Our Swedish campuses are slated to pilot a battery energy storage system BESS solution to remove reliance on generators,24
Hydrogen fuel cells We are also piloting hydrogen fuel cells as viable green energy for backup power at our datacenters We announced a worldwide first in 2020hydrogen fuel cells powering a row of datacenter servers for 48 consecutive hours This successful pilot provided a proof of concept for supporting backup power needs that could be implemented once batteries reach their capacity Our primary power supply to an operating datacenter is now a hydrogen fuel cell,24
We are committed to fully electrifying our global campus operations vehicle fleet of over 1800 vehicles by 2030 Since announcing this target we have spent the last year developing regionally specific implementation strategies analyzing the vehicles and determining the infrastructure needed to support operations In the coming year we will launch a series of pilots appropriate to each region to keep us on track to goal,3
In our Puget Sound campus modernization project we have removed natural gas from campus including cooking over 15000 meals a day with only renewable electricity LinkedIns updated design and build guidelines call for allelectric kitchens powered by renewable energy designed to cook over 5000 meals a day on clean power,24
We are committed to electrifying our global campus vehicle fleet of 1800 vehicles by 2030,24
Our commitment is that by 2030 100 percent of Microsofts energy supply 100 percent of the time will come from carbonfree resources This commitment completes the link between carbonfree resources and our facilities in both space and time,24
Hourly renewable supply and demand matching strategies can help lay the groundwork for a decarbonized grid,17
A path to carbon negative via energy The vast majority of Microsofts direct carbon emissions footprint comes from electricity and as such our work on carbon reduction has centered on using less of it while at the same time ensuring we support the adoption of more carbonfree energy in the grids where we operate While our goal has remained consistentto get to an energy supply that is entirely carbonfreeour approach has evolved as the supply of renewable energy has increased markets have matured and data has become more granular,24
A journey towards 100 percent Our initial commitment set in 2012 was to cover 100 percent of our energy consumption with renewable energy certificates RECs We achieved our goal that same year by purchasing enough RECs to cover our annual energy consumption However a REC purchase is not always a direct contract with new renewable generation and does not always mean that the renewable generation is on the same grid as where we are consuming electrons Put simply pursuing unbundled RECs delinked energy production and consumption in both geography and time reducing the overall impact,24
Recognizing the importance of linking our renewable purchases to new impactful and additional renewable energy projects Microsoft began engaging in renewable energy procurement through power purchase agreements PPAs PPAs are a direct contractual relationship between a purchaser and a supplier for new renewable energy via a project or several projects that is the execution of the PPA provides the necessary revenue stream for new renewable energy projects to be built The direct contract establishes greater investor confidence in renewable projects and paves the way for more renewable generation on the grid,24
We formalized our commitment to procuring energy from new impactful renewable energy projects in 2016 and updated it in 2020 In 2016 Microsoft announced a commitment to increasing proportion of PPA purchases on a path towards 100 percent renewable energy We pledged to procure enough renewable energy to offset 50 percent of our energy consumption by 2018 and 60 percent in the next decade and further specified that wed aim to secure new renewable energy in the geography where our offices and datacenters are bringing a stronger geographic connection between our contracted renewables and our electricity consumption In 2020 as part of our carbon negative announcements we committed to bring our commitment up to 100 percent by 2025 Like our earlier commitments this was on an annual basis requiring us to sign renewable energy offtake agreements to cover our energy needs simply put we will match every electron we consume on an annual basis with renewable energy,24
Moving beyond 100 percent to 1001000 While we are proud of this progress the global shift to net zero carbon energy is not happening quickly enough The International Energy Agency IEA suggests that the path to net zero emissions is very narrow and will require the deployment of all available clean energy technologies between now and 2030 For solar power it is equivalent to installing the worlds largest solar park roughly every day4 This reality is due to the fact that most electrons flowing onto grids today come from carbonintensive sources requiring largescale replacement to meet our energy needs Currently energy storage is not deployed at scale and the grid infrastructure of today is old and inadequate to meet the balancing needs of new renewable energy resources and the integration of net zero carbon resources nor to the increasing consumption demands of a rapidly electrifying society,24
That is why we set a new 1001000 goal in 2021 Our commitment is that by 2030 100 percent of Microsofts energy supply 100 percent of the time will come from zero carbon resources on grids where we operate The 1001000 commitment completes the link between zero carbon resources and our facilities in both space and time,24
Our 1001000 commitment provides a vision and roadmap to pair our operational goals with our research technologies and investments to drive global change We are bringing new research to bear including a white paper authored by RMI that highlights the potential for hourly energy monitoring tools to provide transparency into supply and demand for zero carbon energy The paper illustrates that hourly renewable supply and demand matching strategies can help lay the groundwork for a decarbonized grid,17
The impact of our 1001000 commitment will be significant Matching zero carbon resources in both space and time will reduce Microsofts emissions to zero at all times and also bring benefits to the broader grid since the zero carbon resources we contract for will also be available to serve the grid when our consumption is lower or zero carbon energy output is higher Moreover we will be driving early deployment of advanced resources like hydrogen and long duration storage to fill in the gaps when renewable energy sources are not generating And finally the energy transition will affect all and needs to benefit all which is why we have built climate equity into our purchasing commitments,13
Our impact to date Our renewable and zero carbon commitments to date are having realworld impact Microsoft is one of the largest purchasers of renewable energy in the world Across 2020 and the first part of 2021 Microsoft signed,24
new purchase agreements for approximately 6 GW of renewable energy across 10 countries around the globe This includes over 35 individual deals with 15 of those deals in Europe spanning Denmark Sweden Spain the United Kingdom and Ireland This latest procurement brings our operating and contracted renewable energy projects to 78 GW globally and we are positioned to continue to grow our renewable resource portfolio In addition to these PPAs Microsoft partnered with Volt Energy the only national African American owned solar development company for a 250MW portfolio of solar projects with the intent to create new opportunities for underresourced communities and to help support a more diverse renewable energy industry This builds on our progress on our community purchasing and skilling work with Sol Systems which began a year ago,24
Were also taking our learnings from our operational work and building new products to help accelerate global decarbonization For example our research led to the cocreation and adoption of the first commercial roundtheclock hourly energymatching solution with our utility partner Vattenfall Building on this work were announcing a new aroundtheclock pilot in the Netherlands with energy provider Eneco and FlexiDAO a technology supplier which will match one of our Amsterdam datacenters hourly energy consumption with the Dutch offshore windfarm Borssele,24
We know that our actions alone will not decarbonize the grids but we are committed to taking ambitious action to drive market demand signals that will influence the speed and scale at which the transformation happens As Microsoft builds the tools and markets to meet our zero carbon commitments we are mindful of the need for products purchases and policy that will enable a carbonfree energy system for all,4
Every net zero scenario shares a common and essential element a massive increase in electrification Electricity holds the promise of wiping out vast sections of the global emissions portfolio but this only happens if the electrons supplying the electricity are generated from zero carbon energy sources,24
Our Sweden datacenter will be fully supplied with hourly energy consumption with an offshore windfarm,24
We are committed to reducing our Scope 3 emissions by more than half by 2030 We will achieve this through reduction strategies in campuses and datacenters rethinking design of our devices and engaging with our supply chain,17
Reducing Scope 3 emissions We are committed to reducing our Scope 3 emissions by more than half by 2030 While we do not have direct control over most emissions in the Scope 3 category because they are generated by third parties they represent more than 97 percent of our total emissions Our carbon negative commitment includes reducing these emissions and removing what we cannot reduce which we do through a reduction strategy in campuses and datacenters rethinking the design of our devices and engaging with our supply chain This year we saw an increase in Scope 3 emissions driven mainly by the growth of our cloud services business and an increase in the sales and usage of our devices,25
Campuses and datacenters Changing the way we work begins with measuring our impact on the planet This includes looking at embodied carbon in each material that goes into our buildings as well as the future of how we work travel and think about events,23
Designing embodied carbon out of our buildings Were committed to reducing not just operational carbon but also embodied carbonthe carbon emitted during the manufacture and transport of building materialswhich accounts for at least 11 percent of global emissions and has historically been harder to track and reduce We have taken a number of steps to address and lower our carbon footprint,25
Our Silicon Valley campus includes the largest mass timber building in the United States,3
Microsoft partnered with other industry leaders to create a new opensource Azurehosted tool the Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator EC3 to track the embodied carbon of the raw building materials We used the EC3 tool in designing 17 new buildings 3 million square feet in our Puget Sound campus modernization project where we are on track to reduce embodied carbon emissions by at least 30 percent We are now using the EC3 tool around the world in both our campuses and our datacenters to track and reduce embodied carbon and have found opportunities to reduce concrete and steel embodied carbon by 30 to 60 percent in our datacenters5,25
Microsoft and our general contractors are creating a baseline for construction process emissions which include transportation of materials to the construction site and construction installation To date there has been little data and no established industryconsistent methodology for creating a baseline making it difficult for design teams to know if their emissions are better or worse than a typical construction project We piloted the tracking of construction activity emissions in our Puget Sound campus modernization project starting with the demolition phase including site excavation as well as how much water we used,21
Lowcarbon materials We also completed research on lowcarbon materials in collaboration with Carbon Leadership Forum CLF a nonprofit industry academic organization at the University of Washington The research explores six lowcarbon materialsearthen slabs nonPortland cement concrete slabs algaegrown brickspanels mycelium mushroom structural tubes purposegrown fiber and agricultural waste panels that can help reduce carbon emissions and change the climate profile of building constructions We are piloting the use of these materials for our datacenters,19
We are innovating and investing in lowcarbon building materials across our global campuses and datacenters with the aim to achieve net zero embodied carbon,15
We are innovating and investing in lowcarbon building materials across our global campuses and datacenters with the aim to achieve net zero embodied carbon including the following,15
Mass timber At our Silicon Valley campus we are using mass timber resulting in the largest mass timber building in the United States In addition to using this lower carbon building material we elected to keep two of the existing buildings on the site providing 36 percent of the new campus footprint and accounting for a 286 percent reduction in total embodied carbon5 With two floors of mass timber the embodied carbon savings increases to approximately 36 percent with an estimated total of 372 kg CO2e per square meter5 With over 345000 square feet or 2400 tons of 100 percent Forest Stewardship Council FSC certified mass timber the wood reflects biophilic principles and a reduced carbon mission We continue to incorporate mass timber on our campuses and are now testing the suitability of mass timber in datacenter environments and investigating sites to pilot these new materials,17
Cement Cement accounts for approximately 8 percent of global emissions We are testing and piloting low GHG cement innovations like CarbonCure to reduce the carbon footprint of our buildings LinkedIn is using lowcarbon and carbonsequestering concrete mixes for our new Silicon Valley headquarters and is now using these materials in our LinkedIn Dublin campus In our datacenters we are reducing how much cement we use by utilizing longer 56day cure times in lieu of typical 28day cure times We are also specifying the use of cement replacement products such as fly ash and slag that reduce the carbon footprint of concrete,19
This year we became a founding member in SABA This year we became a founding member in SABA,12
Rethinking how we travel Although emissions related to business travel represented less than 5 percent of our total emissions we know that we can have a larger impact with our investments and partnerships We have made two investments in SAF with airline partners KLM and Alaska This year we expanded this work by becoming a founding member in the Sustainable Aviation Buyers,25
Alliance SABA and participating in the World Economic Forums Clean Skies for Tomorrow We are actively supporting the development of an SAF certificate which will set GHG accounting standards for the use of SAF to reduce emissions by both customers and airlines in the future We are also looking to reduce emissions in other areas where our learnings in SAF can be applied from freight and logistics to the fuel used in our datacenter backup generators,25
Reduction in total carbon emissions of 30 percent for Surface Laptop Studio versus its predecessor Surface Book 3 13,25
Devices Over the past year devices became even more essential as they kept us connected working and learning through the pandemic This year higherthananticipated demand translated to higher sales and greater usage which caused our absolute emissions to grow We are committed to reducing the carbon intensity of our devices and our efforts have also grown this year We have made significant investments to expand our datadriven lifecycle assessment LCA and telemetry approach to better measure inform and prioritize top reduction opportunities to reduce our device carbon intensity across the full lifecycle of our devices,24
These efforts include carbonconscious design reducing supply chain emissions innovating energyefficient hardware and software in use and enabling product repairability reusability and recyclability This will allow us to deliver the best product experience with lower carbon intensity while also partnering with our users to minimize carbon footprint when using our products,15
Building a datadriven platform for product design In 2020 we began working on a platform to allow engineers to make realtime design and material selection decisions based on carbon impact a key enabler in modeling and reducing our future device emissions To generate our device carbon footprints we conduct LCAs in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 which enable us to estimate emissions from manufacturing our devices down to the individual component level Further we are upgrading our audit management sourcing tool to ensure supplier carbon reduction initiatives are fully reflected in these product carbon footprints We pair this with improved product usage and distribution data For example the most recent iterations of the Xbox Series XS have improved our awareness of full ecosystem energy usage from consoles information which is critical to future energy efficiency improvements and emissions reductions These investments allow us more control over our product emissions across their full lifecycle,24
Experimenting with lower carbon design As informed by our LCAs a significant lever in product development is the engineering of lowcarbon design alternatives such as using recycled materials and designing for a smaller manufacturing footprint,15
We designed our Surface Laptop Studio to allow for stamping a lowerwaste manufacturing technique that reduced our aluminum scrap rate for the products base by at least 25 percent a key contributor to an overall product carbon reduction of 30 percent versus its predecessor the Surface Book 3 136,15
We are developing opportunities to reuse manufacturing scrap in aluminum production allowing us to use lower carbon 100 percent postindustrial recycled closed loop aluminum for future Surface computer housings For neodymium in magnets a rare earth material we are also exploring postindustrial scrap as a manufacturing feedstock enabling us to produce 100 percent recycled neodymium in magnets for future products,19
In our labs we are working to engineer a lowercarbon and reducedwaste flaxbased wiring board and experimenting with 3D printing we have started to explore 100 percent postindustrial recycled tin in our soldering paste and we are aiming to reduce overall materials needed through new spacing guidelines that can shrink our circuit boards in size by up to 25 percent,15
Software design can also increase efficiency We are focused on offering lowemissions usage options such as Energysaving mode on Xbox which can reduce power usage during standby mode from 15 W down to 052 W as well as Xbox Cloud Gaming which will be powered by Azure datacenters running on 100 renewable energy by 2025 With the release of energysaving mode we are updating the initial bootup experience for users to provide clear messaging to enable user understanding of power modes while encouraging them to implement energysaving mode on their consoles This will be paired with a reduction in idle and shutdown timers to continue to improve power consumption during console idle periods,24
Providing transparency for customers To increase transparency for customers and stakeholders we publish LCA results for our Xbox consoles and Surface devices The LCA results are contained in our Ecoprofiles along with information about the products material composition energy consumption packaging ecolabels product recycling and other environmental attributes,0
We have also developed a new dynamic way for commercial customers to gain insight into the carbon footprint of their entire Surface device fleets The Microsoft Surface Emissions Estimator enables sellers to work with customers and estimate the carbon impact of the Surface devices and key accessories they purchase from us,25
Total energy consumption for the Surface Pro 8 is 17 percent smaller than Pro 7,24
Energysaving mode can reduce Xbox power usage in standby mode by over 80 percent,24
Reducing the footprint of distribution Microsoft is an active member in the Global Logistics Emissions Council GLEC an industry collaboration through Smart Freight Centre committing to reducing logistics emissions through sustainable freight initiatives Microsoft uses this framework to calculate and measure the carbon impact of its Scope 3 transportation emissions7,25
For shipping we have an intelligent platform to measure our emissions impact down to individual shipments and a carbon emissions budget has been developed utilizing the same methodology In our distribution network this year we finished a complete conversion of our primary distribution center in Europe to 100 percent renewable energy This facility now generates 13 million kWh from solar energy and avoids 690 mtCO2 annually Through FY22 we will plan to convert our US distribution centers to 100 percent renewable energy through solar panel installations and using green renewable sources,24
We are also building more sustainable shipping options such as the delivery option launched in December 2021 to avoid highercarbon air freight to give customers a choice of more sustainable options when ordering from Microsoft,24
Boosting efficiency of devices in use For Microsoft devices energy efficiency is a balance of hardware and software innovation This year overall device and console use phase emissions grew as a result of higher sales and usage from customers reliant on these products during the pandemic That being said several of our newest products launched in 2021 were designed to be the most energy efficient devices in their product lines including the Surface Pro 8 and Surface Laptop 4 running Windows 11 The most recent iterations of the Xbox Series XS have improved our awareness of full ecosystem energy usage from consoles information which is critical to future energy efficiency improvements and emissions reductions,24
In 2021 we released a set of indepth capacitybuilding tools and resources to help our suppliers report their GHG emissions develop clean energy strategies and reduce their energy related emissions,25
Supply chain In July 2020 Microsoft added additional sustainability requirements to its Supplier Code of Conduct to support the companys bold carbon ambitions This new language requires suppliers to disclose their own carbon footprints and develop plans to reduce them Microsoft has spent the past year rolling out these requirements to a subset of its suppliers and building a program to support them,17
Engaging with suppliers on reduction roadmaps In July 2021 87 percent of Microsofts inscope suppliers reported their emissions to CDP up 12 percent from 2020 Following the closure of the CDP cycle we worked with suppliers to build action plans of emission reduction activities leading up to 2030 This included educational webinars and oneonone meetings with suppliers to dive into their individual footprints and discuss relevant reduction levers Microsoft also provided suppliers with resources to aid in their reduction efforts We continue to believe that for Microsoft to reach our reduction goals collaboration with suppliers is fundamental and we look forward to continuing the journey together,21
manufacturing delivery and use towards a diversified approach after decommissioning this integrated plan ensures that assets are dispositioned to optimize value security compliance and sustainability Over the past year we have engaged with new suppliers who are able to remanufacture assets and components effectively enabling new lifecycles for our assets We have successfully demonstrated takebackbuyback models with our original asset suppliers closing the loop on assets and enabling suppliers to repurpose or reuse assets and components resulting in significant sustainability outcomes for emissions reduction and material recovery Our Circular Center program will enable 90 percent reuse of datacenter computing assets significantly contributing to our goal of reducing emissions by more than 50 percent by 2030 In FY21 our overall reuse of assets was 78 percent,17
Using lifecycle assessments for targeted hardware improvements As we outline in Chapter 4 of our Responsible Sourcing 2021 Report we are executing an ambitious plan to empower all strategic device suppliers to commit to sciencebased carbon reduction activities specifically targeted to reduce emissions associated with hardware manufacturing We have used LCAs to prioritize supplier categories that contribute the greatest emissions as well as the types of actions suppliers can take to make the biggest shifts in decarbonization including powering their operations with renewable energy increasing process and energy efficiencies and reducing material use and waste onsite,17
To learn more see Chapter 4 of the Responsible Sourcing 2021 Report,17
Providing new tools and training for supplier reporting When Microsoft rolled out emission reporting and reduction requirements in our Supplier Code of Conduct the top feedback from suppliers was the need for simple yet comprehensive resources to walk them through the carbon accounting process In response we released a set of indepth capacitybuilding tools and resources developed in partnership with ENGIE Impact WSP and CDP to help companies and particularly our suppliers report their GHG emissions develop clean energy strategies and reduce their energyrelated emissions In September 2021 LinkedIn released a new course Fundamentals of Sustainable Supply Chain Management to help organizations and professionals more effectively engage with their suppliers,25
Building new forms of financing for suppliers Based on our engagements with suppliers we knew more technical resources were necessary but insufficient to drive change Our suppliers need access to new forms of finance to invest in new solutions This year we launched a new partnership with the International Finance Corporation IFC a member of the World Bank Group IFC will work with designated Microsoft suppliers in emerging markets starting in Asia to identify technical solutions reducing GHG emissions provide implementation assistance and offer financing solutions to help them make investments in more efficient and lowcarbon operations,25
Reimagining circularity in our supply chain We have taken a firstofakind approach towards designing and implementing Circular Centers in our datacenter campuses aligning our endoflife dispositioning processes with an integrated plan across the entire supply chain From sustainable design at the start of an asset lifecycle to sustainable sourcing,17
Removing carbon In January 2021 Microsoft announced that we had made the worlds largest purchase of carbon removal in history Our focus on removals instead of avoided emissions offsets is aligned to our carbon negative commitment but is also motivated by what climate science tells us is needed to reach net zerospecifically the IPCCs projection that the planet could need as much as 10 gigatons of carbon dioxide removal by midcentury depending on the scale and pace of decarbonization With our purchases as well as our investments we are working to help build this new market with integrity and quality,25
It hasnt been easy As we documented in our September 2021 Nature article highquality carbon removal is scarce for three reasons First there is not a clear common definition of net zero and the role that removals play in net zero goals Second removals are not well accounted for in the practice of carbon measurement which itself is still evolving And third the removal market is very young especially for truly permanent carbon removal which is prohibitively expensive,25
We know that were among the early entities to do homework on this topic and thats why we are committed to sharing lessons learned as documented in our 2021 white paper and highquality removal criteria We are actively working with our Climate Innovation Fund to invest in promising carbon removal companies We have contributed comments to policy frameworks that set the standards for carbon removal such as a carbon removal certification program by the European Commission and efforts by the United States federal government both the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Energy to specify highquality removal And we continue to evolve our own removal portfolio mix to be a balance of lowdurability and highdurability volumes,12
Carbon removal projects In our first year we chose projects that will help meet our commitment while supporting innovation in the market including the following,25
Communitybased reforestation Taking Roots CommuniTree reforestation in Nicaragua the largest such project in the countrypartners with farming families to help develop sustainable livelihoods by growing native tree species on marginal farmland The United Nations and the European Union have used this project as a model for reforestation,23
Biochar We invested in a portfolio from Puroearth Oy including from Carbon Cycle Carbofex and ECHO2 small operations in Germany Finland and Australia that use biomass residue for example wood chips and forest waste to sequester carbon dioxide in biochar for use in soil amendment and other products,19
Direct air capture We are actively working with our Climate Innovation Fund to invest in promising carbon removal companies and projects Climeworks Orca direct air capture plant in Iceland removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stores it permanently underground using a mineralization technology developed by the Icelandic company Carbfix,21
Our FY22 aspiration was even larger aiming for 15 million mtCO2 We launched a new request for proposals in July 2021 seeking the highest quality of projects on the market both naturebased and engineered We are on a path to fulfilling that goal with 11 million mtCO2 contracted to date in FY22,12
Looking ahead we know that the market needs to improve the quality of carbon removal accounting and that we need to have a clearer line of sight to affordable supply Thats why in 2021 we undertook the following projects,17
In partnership with Carbon Direct we published our carbon dioxide removal guidance These criteria are our minimal viable specifications for the most common project types that we will consider for procurement We will continue to expand on our criteria as the market adapts and see this as part of our market development work,25
We funded research by CarbonPlan to produce their lessons learned and analysis from a systematic review of 14 protocols for soil carbon offsets for buyers from projects in the voluntary market today,25
We commissioned a report from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on likely carbon removal supply and cost projections for 2030 which will be available in Q1 of 2022,17
of Vermont University of Minnesota Concordia University and Simon Fraser University to develop and explore the climate implications of temporary carbon storage in nature as a means to inform our carbon removal strategies,25
Climate Solutions and the carbon removal workgroup of the World Economic Forums Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders,13
The worlds climate experts agree that people companies industries and nations must take urgent action to reduce carbon emissions Reducing carbon emissions and addressing environmental equity require collective measures to understand and mitigate environmental impacts,13
Microsoft and our partners have been investing in technologies across every industry and region to help companies face new and shifting market conditions The rapid pace of this transformation has the potential to change the world for the better,18
Organizations need to be able to record their environmental footprint report to stakeholders reduce their resource usage remove their footprint through carbon offsets or recycling and replace highfootprint resources with lowfootprint ones,17
Product Microsoft is leading new product innovations for the benefit of our planet With new offerings ranging from providing transparency on the footprint of our devices and services to digital supply chains that improve business processes and reduce carbon footprints to IoT sensors streaming realtime telemetry for predictive analytics there is no shortage of examples of how technology can enable ambitious sustainability outcomes,17

Microsoft is advocating for common accounting and public disclosure of carbon and climaterelated information,13
FY21 was a year of progress and learning for Microsoft on our journey to carbon negative,3
Carbon removal demand is hotand durable supply is short,17
Carbon removal still lacks common standards needed to scale,12
Carbon removal is a sellers market The pipeline is short for surging demand and corporate buyers need more project development Climate change is further complicating this as wildfires erode the forest carbon purchases weve made and we as well as other purchasers need expanded credit buffers to ensure credits we pay for are removing carbon from the atmosphere,13
Projects dont consistently account for durability additionality and leakage To scale the market in the long term we need the enabling infrastructure to measure monitor and verify carbon removal quality now and we need clear guidelines under the Paris Agreement about how to reconcile corporate and countrylevel actions See Microsoft Carbon Removal Lessons From an Early Corporate Purchase to learn more,18
Progress on carbon reduction will be lumpy as carbon data and measurement improves,24
Climate change is a global issue whose impacts are felt locally,13
As Microsoft and the world mature in carbon accounting we will continue to get better at understanding how our decisions reduce or sometimes increase carbon emissions For example some of the data used to estimate hardware emissions within certain categories of Scope 3 is drawn from industryaverage secondary data rather than directly from suppliers This data may not be reflective of recent supplier activity which may cause fluctuations in emissions as primary data from suppliers is introduced,25
Displacing incumbent technologies and spurring innovation needs to be supported in all geographies to address the uneven distribution of those impactsboth positive and negativearound the world,3
Small percentages of our emissions require big efforts to address,25
For example diesel fuel accounts for less than 1 percent of Microsofts overall emissions But finding solutions to reduce reliance on traditional diesel fuels which power the backup infrastructure that supports our datacenters will require significant innovation and investment by those with a much greater stake and reward than Microsoft alone This same scenario plays out for electrifying our fleet and transitioning to induction cooktops,24

To meet our commitment to being water positive by 2030 we will reduce our water footprint across our direct operations while replenishing and increasing water access in water stressed regions where we work,20
Reducing our water footprint We are taking new approaches to water collection treatment reuse and reduction at our campuses and datacenters across the globe This includes efficiency measures as well as fitforpurpose water usage designwe are focused on using the right type of water in the right context from campus to datacenters to device manufacturing Key efforts include the following,20
Using less reusing more and recycling water across our datacenters Microsoft is using the Smart Water Navigator which we developed with Ecolab in our datacenters to prioritize and manage incoming water quality sources like recycled water In San Antonio Texas we have significantly reduced the datacenters potable water usage which will now be used to supply water to homes providing economic as well as environmental benefits We deployed sensors in our Quincy Washington datacenter location where were using the data on realtime water quality to drive operational insights and adjustments to maintenance and water chemistry Across our operations were testing new techniques like raising supply air temperatures and harvesting water from our rooftops to further reduce water consumption,20
Using the right type of water in the right context in datacenters,20
Keeping datacenters cool using air Across our global datacenter fleet outside air is our primary method of cooling for an average of nine months of the year External temperatures and humidity play a key role in determining when additional cooling is requiredand when required we utilize an adiabatic cooling system to reduce air temperature by evaporating water in its presence Adiabatic cooling along with higher temperature operations significantly reduces power and water usage when comparing to mechanical waterbased cooling systems At our new datacenter region in Arizona which opened in June 2020 we use zero water for cooling for more than half the year taking advantage of adiabatic cooling We are also partnering with First Solar to provide solar energy rather than traditional electricity generation which will reduce power plant cooling water,24
At our new datacenter region in Arizona we use zero water for cooling for more than half the year taking advantage of adiabatic cooling,20
Pioneering research and implementation of liquid immersion cooling to reduce water In 2021 Microsoft was the first cloud provider to run twophased liquid immersion cooling in a production environment demonstrating viability for broader use in our datacenters We are using liquid immersion in a production environment which involves placing servers in a tub of inert fluid that boils at 50C which removes the heat generated by the chips servers and power supplies and condenses the fluid in coils at the top of the rack This rains back in the tank Because of the elevated operating temperature this type of cooling does not require use of evaporated water Our latest testing addresses the concept of overclocking which is to operate chip components beyond their predefined voltage thermal and power design limits to further improve performance Our tests found that some chipsets show an increased performance by 20 percent with liquid cooling This may also have benefits beyond reduction of water use as this approach can allow for datacenter rack designs that create increased capacity per square foot in a datacenter,20
Raising the temperature while maintaining quality Were investigating and piloting turning up the heat in our datacenters The higher server inlet temperatures will reduce cooling hours and water use If the pilot is successful we expect to be fully implemented by 2025 which has the potential to eliminate water use for cooling in regions like Amsterdam and Dublin while reducing water use in dry regions like Arizona and Wyoming,20
In Hyderabad India were piloting airtowater generators to help offset 4 million liters of ground water extraction per year,20
Building net zero campus in California In 2021 our new Silicon Valley campus officially opened It is now operating as the first technology campus with a net zero water certification as not a drop of water for more than 2000 employees 15 acres of landscape and 643000 square feet of built space will come from municipal sources beyond drinking fountains and sinks,20
Recycling water in our campuses Our Herzliya Israel sites landscaping also uses 100 percent of the air conditioning condensate water for its irrigation and cooling towers resulting in an estimated savings of over 3 million liters annually Our LinkedIn headquarters in California is planning to utilize municipal recycled water for landscaping and internal plumbing thus saving 30 million liters of potable water each year,20
Testing new generation techniques Our Herzliya Israel site utilizes Watergens technology to produce fresh drinking water from the humidity in the air producing an estimated 237000 liters annually based on company calculations In Hyderabad India were piloting airtowater generators that will capture the moisture in humid air purify it and produce safe drinking water These generator plants will help offset 4 million liters of ground water extraction per year based on company calculations in this waterstressed region where water scarcity is an ongoing crisis that is expected to worsen,20
Reducing water in device textiles Microsoft uses textiles in our computer palm rests and type covers and the textile industry is one of the biggest consumers of water Each of the various manufacturing phases including yarn processing greige production and the dyeing finish process requires a significant amount of water To reduce water we removed the dyeing process on our CLARINO fabric by switching to a solution dye technique which reduces water consumption by 20 percent This is a completely solvent free environmentally friendly manufacturing choice that is used in three of our products currently in production across the HoloLens and Surface type cover lines,20
Replenishing water As part of our commitment to be water positive by 2030 we will replenish more water than we consume focusing on high waterstressed regions We will achieve this goal by investing in water projects that protect watersheds restore wetlands and improve infrastructure In addition to generating volumetric water benefits many projects offer a wide range of additional cobenefits,20
When sourcing water replenishment projects we consider contextual conditions of the watershed and aim to invest in projects that align with sitespecific water assessments and have local stakeholder support,20
We have invested in 21 projects to date in nine water basins across the globe In FY21 Microsoft invested in projects that are expected to generate over 13 million cubic meters of volumetric benefits Progress towards our commitment is made possible due to several strategic partnerships with nongovernmental organizations such as Bonneville Environmental Foundation BEF the Water Resilience Coalition WRC the Nature Conservancy and implementation partners including Trout Unlimited Ducks Unlimited National Audubon Society and WaterAid We also participate in the California Water Action Collaborative a network of over 25 organizations learning together collectively developing projects and advancing innovative solutions to improve water security and resilience across California,20
Reversing environmental degradation in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges Reversing environmental degradation in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges,23
In FY21 Microsoft invested in replenishment projects that are expected to generate over 13 million cubic meters of volumetric benefits,24
Given the nascent water replenishment project market we make investments at least a fiscal year before a project delivers volumetric benefits We are still able to make estimates on volumetric benefits just as we do with renewable energy projects upon signing even though the project has yet to be built We are taking new steps to validate these estimates In FY21 10 of Microsofts replenishment project investments underwent a third party quantification to verify and update the initial volumetric benefit estimates using the Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting VWBA guidance We will continue to use the VWBA guidance to quantify volumetric water benefits when contracting with a replenishment partner,20
Many projects are already delivering volumetric ecosystem and community benefits such as the following,23
Restoring the East Creek meadow Microsoft has invested in a project to restore the East Creek meadow and reverse environmental degradation caused by disconnection of the channels in Californias Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Mountain ranges from the meadows and floodplains below September 2021 groundwater levels indicate that the meadow is beginning to retain groundwater during the dry season even with reduced precipitation and lateseason contributions from snowpack runoff The restoration has also contributed to fire resiliency within two months of the Dixie fire native species were resprouting in the burned areas due to residual soil moisture,23
Drought contingency planning with the Colorado River Indian Tribes Under the Drought Contingency Plan Arizona is seeking to help stabilize water levels in Lake Mead and reduce the impact and severity of shortage declarations in Nevada Arizona and Southern California by financially compensating the Colorado River Indian Tribes CRIT,20
for water saved Microsoft has contributed funds to compensate the CRIT for their water rights to the Colorado River through a lease for system conservation and water supply benefits In exchange for monetary compensation the CRIT have pledged to forgo irrigation water deliveries and fallow approximately 10000 acres of farmland leaving significant volumes in Lake Mead over the next few years,20
We will replenish more water than we consume focusing on high waterstressed regions and investing in water projects that protect watersheds restore wetlands and improve infrastructure,20
Groundwater recharge and water security in Phoenix Microsoft and Gila River Water Storage are recharging and replenishing groundwater levels in the cities of Goodyear and El Mirage Arizona to balance a portion of Microsofts future water use contributing an estimated additional 610000 cubic meters Microsoft is also collaborating with The Nature Conservancy to support water conservation in the Verde River Basin in Arizona through projects such as piping irrigation ditches to efficiently water farmland and leave more water in the Verde River,20
Restoration in the Columbia Basin Microsoft supported three water restoration projects in the Columbia River Basin near Quincy Washington One of the projects benefits the Roaring Creek by improving habitat for fish listed under the Endangered Species Act including Upper Columbia Steelhead spring Chinook bull trout lamprey and cutthroat trout The second project is focused on relocation of beavers to watersheds where natural beaver dam building helps to promote fish passage improves water quality increases groundwater storage and mitigates flooding The third project improves water use efficiency on farm and irrigation delivery infrastructure to help local agricultural producers adapt to changing growing conditions while also supporting rivers and local fish,20
Stabilizing lake levels in Lake Mead to reduce water shortage,20

Programs run through Waterorg account for over 670 million liters of water benefit per year,20
Improving access to water With 11 billion people in the world without access to clean water its not enough to simply reduce and replenishwe need to improve peoples access to safe clean water Our goal is to provide access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation solutions for 15 million people while accounting for 25 billion liters of net positive water impact in highstress watersheds where we also operate namely India Indonesia and Mexico by 2030,20
Progressing towards our goal with Waterorg In 2020 we began our work with Waterorg to help people living in underserved communities gain lasting and reliable access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation solutions This includes household taps and toilets piped connections rainwater harvesting water storage purification and community filtration In FY21 we helped more than 95000 people in India and Indonesia10 and expect to reach at least 840000 people by September 2023 Nearly all the beneficiaries are women and live below the poverty line These programs account for over 670 million liters of water benefit per year in areas facing water scarcity and climate challenges that overlap with our business operations in strategic locations9,20
Affordable water and sanitation loans in India for piped water in homes Affordable water and sanitation loans in India for piped water in homes,20
Providing safe water and improved sanitation in India,20
In Rasulpur Aul Kendrapara houses are made of thatch mud and concrete and rarely have water or sanitation connections Rehana and her daughter used to walk up to six hours a day to get water for cooking laundry and baths from an unreliable handpump managed by the government On days it was unavailable,20
they collected water from the river or purchased it from a vendor paying high prices for water in time and money Families like Rehanas find the small water and sanitation loans offered by Waterorgs partners in India to be affordable practical solutions to their familys water and sanitation needs Rehana learned that she could make affordable payments to establish a water connection and was approved for a loan to construct a piped water connection from the municipal water line to her home Now the family enjoys access to safe water and improved sanitation at home,20
We are not a particularly large consumer of water today but we are learning from our work in our own operations We are taking these lessons learned new approaches and innovative partnerships and bringing them to our global customer base where we believe we can have a transformative impact,15
As it so often does the pathway to progress begins with data Water data is often segmented and siloed both within an organization and across multiple organizations operating in the same watershed which makes managing a shared resource particularly challenging Water data often lacks context meaning it is provided without an understanding of underlying conditions in the area,20
We believe that Microsofts most important contribution to water reduction will come not from our own work alone but by helping our customers partners and suppliers around the world reduce their water footprints through our learnings and with the power of data AI and digital technology,20
This makes it difficult for any single organization to assess its impact on a water basin which in turn complicates or obscures the most impactful intervention to address water issues in that area In addition water data often suffers from discontinuities where data collection is interrupted due to equipment failure or lack of funding for observational networks,20
The digitization of water data is about making water data credible transparent useful and actionable It includes the Internet of Things IoT cloud platforms business intelligence and AI We are bringing new solutions to organizations to better manage water consumption and risk,20
With this tool available today organizations can remotely monitor and control water flow and valve pressure manage alerts and set up device commands to reduce water costs and waste,20

We hope that our circular economy investments and approaches will inspire the broader sector in the same way as our carbon negative goal Everyone must do their part,12
Our commitment zero waste by 2030 across our direct waste footprint,19
Increasing reuse of servers and components through Circular Centers By 2025 90 percent of servers and components within our regional datacenter networks will be reused,15
Driving to zero waste operations We will achieve 90 percent diversion of operational waste at datacenters and campuses and 75 percent diversion for all construction and deconstruction projects by 2030,19
Eliminating singleuse plastic By 2025 we will eliminate singleuse plastics in all Microsoft primary product packaging and all IT asset packaging in our datacenters,15
Transforming waste accounting We will continue to improve waste data accounting to ensure accuracy auditability and reporting,19
Making fully recyclable products and packaging We will design Surface devices Xbox products and accessories and all Microsoft product packaging to be 100 percent recyclable in OECD countries by 2030,15
Investing in the future of circularity We will partner with companies around the world to drive circular economy innovation and adoption of technologies to reduce waste and reuse materials and products,15
The context Every year people consume 100 billion tons of materials and in 2020 only 86 percent of those materials were cycled back into the economy after use according to the 2021 Circularity Gap Report Linear systems and existing infrastructure are not adequate to maintain collect and redistribute materials effectively for a global circular economy As a result waste including plastics ewaste and food waste pollutes our land clogs our waterways depletes natural resources and contaminates the air we breathe,19
We recognize the urgent need to protect the worlds biodiversity and ecosystems give equal access to a safe and healthy environment reduce carbon emissions associated with the creation and endoflife of these materials and meet the needs of a growing population As a company that makes and manufactures devices as well as uses manufactured goods in our campuses datacenters and operations we have an obligation to responsibly source materials and an opportunity to build a more circular approach into our work and the world,23
To reach our commitment to become a zero waste company by 2030 we are taking an increasingly circular approach to materials management to reduce waste and carbon emissions Our strategy goes beyond waste diversion as we work across our value chain beginning with design and material selection Wherever possible we reduce the amount of materials needed We responsibly source materials for our operations products and packaging We are increasing the use of recycled content selecting recyclable or compostable materials reducing hazardous substances and designing out waste We keep products and materials in use longer through reuse repair and recycling programs,19
We have planned five Circular Centers with Amsterdam open construction underway in Boydton Virginia and three more to be added in Dublin Chicago and Singapore in 2022 This has projected savings of 100 million per year once fully scaled and will enable 90 percent reuse by 2025,24
We reduced singleuse plastics in our Microsoft product packaging by 18 percent or from 57 percent to 47 percent by weight on average of plastic per package in FY21,15
In FY21 we diverted more than 15200 metric tons of solid waste otherwise headed to landfills and incinerators across our direct operational footprint,19
We achieved a 97 percent recyclable Xbox Series X and S and a 93 percent recyclable metal Surface Laptop 4 in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD countries per the UL methodology ECVP 2789,15
Four datacenters are Zero Waste certified with new certifications for the San Antonio Texas and Quincy Washington datacenters and renewed certifications for our Boydton Virginia and Dublin Ireland locations,19
Eleven campuses now have customized roadmaps to achieve zero waste by 2030 Our Puget Sound campus has been Zero Waste certified since 2016,19
We transformed our waste accounting using Microsoft technology including PowerApps Dynamics 365 and Power BI increasing our collection of actual waste data and providing greater visibility into waste types,19
We introduced two new accessories that are made in part from recycled waste materials several new Xbox Wireless Controllers built using over 30 percent postconsumer recycled PCR materials and the Ocean Plastic Mouse which has a plastic shell made with 20 percent recycled ocean plastic,19
We invested in circular economy startup Rheaply to help companies measure carbon emissions savings from reuse and fuel the circular economy,24
A year of progress and impact to get to zero waste by 2030,19
Working towards our target to divert 90 percent of operational solid waste from landfills and incinerators across our owned datacenters and campuses In FY21 our diversion rate remained nearly flat from FY20 and we diverted more than 12600 metric tons of waste from being landfilled or incinerated Employees working from home was one of the main drivers of the decrease of over 444 percent in total waste generated,19
Ensuring 90 percent of servers and components for all cloud hardware will be reused by 2025 The main drivers of our reuse percentage are the functional equipment that is remarketed either whole or partedout or materials that could be reused after the recycling process In FY21 a reduction in the volume of decommissioned assets and increase in the volume of recyclable material in the mix contributed to the overall reduction in the reuse percentage Expansion of our Circular Centers program and investments in systems and policy changes will further enable us to achieve our 90 percent reuse target of servers and components by 2025,15
a Waste generation values and classifications have been updated for FY19 and FY20 to be,19
consistent with data collection and estimation methodology improvements established in FY21 As we continue improving our waste accounting our reported values may change,12
a Our program and supplier data quality has consistently improved over the years Access to more,17
accurate data has helped us update our methodology for percentage reuse calculation For consistency previously reported years have been updated to reflect latest methodology applied to FY21,12
To meet our commitment to being zero waste by 2030 we are reducing reusing and diverting waste in our campuses and datacenters We are also focused on keeping our products and packaging in use longer by designing for circularity,19
Campuses and datacenters Our operations are a considerable part of our waste footprint Getting to zero waste requires more ambitious efforts to reduce as much waste as we can reuse products to extend use life and recycle or compost wherever possible as well as thinking through everything from visitor badges to server racks with circularity in mind,19
Building a circular cloud At Microsoft we have taken a firstofakind approach towards designing and implementing circularity into our cloud aligning our endoflife dispositioning processes with an integrated plan across the entire supply chain It starts with sustainable design and responsible sourcing of an asset We use our assets as long as we can effectively then reuse what we can to extend hardware life After decommissioning we move towards a diversified approach ensuring that assets are dispositioned to optimize value security compliance and sustainability Over the past year we engaged new suppliers who are able to remanufacture assets and components effectively enabling new lifecycles for our assets We have successfully demonstrated takeback buyback models with our original asset suppliers closing the loop on assets and enabling suppliers to repurpose or reuse assets and components returning higher financial benefits as well as significant sustainability outcomes for carbon emissions reduction and material recovery,17
We have built Circular Centers inside our large datacenter campuses to intercept and process all decommissioned assets These include an intelligent disposition and routing system using Azure SQL Power BI and Embedded Power Apps integrated with Dynamics 365 which determines the optimal route for every component creating a plan for every part extending useful lifecycles well beyond the datacenter and engaging our upstream and downstream suppliers,17
Our circular cloud will enable 90 percent reuse of datacenter hardware by 2025,1
The Circular Centers are also a significant contributor to our spares program using harvested components from decommissioned assets to repair cloud hardware Increasingly such approaches are creating more value and enabling greater resilience across our supply chain Our circular cloud will enable 90 percent reuse of datacenter hardware by 2025 significantly contributing to our goal of achieving zero waste datacenters by 2030 and goal of more than 50 percent emissions reduction by 2030,17
Reusing cloud hardware via Circular Centers A critical piece of achieving our zero waste goal is managing ewaste from our growing datacenters Last year we piloted a new approach to asset reuse by building a Circular Center within our Amsterdam datacenter campus which represents 7 percent of our server capacity globally We process decommissioned cloud hardware to service strategic routes secondary markets and suppliers using intelligent routing software in combination with Dynamics 365,1
Our goal is 75 percent construction and deconstruction waste diversion for all projects,19
Our goal is 90 percent waste diversion for campus projects over 75000 square feet,19
Zero waste campuses Weve created a roadmap for key zero waste initiatives for each campus and committed to Zero Waste certifications by 2030 for all Microsoft campuses LinkedIns new campus in Omaha opened in 2021 with a focus on zero waste which led to the team utilizing reclaimed wood wherever possible including tabletops lockers and stairs 52 percent of the wood on the project is reclaimed and the remaining 48 percent is FSC certified,19
Construction waste diversion Microsoft has a goal of 75 percent construction waste diversion for all projects and 90 percent for campus projects over 75000 square feet To reach these goals Microsoft and LinkedIn are refining RFIs for vendors standardizing waste tracking and reporting and establishing a decommissioning partner to ensure that our used furniture and materials are reused Our Puget Sound campus modernization project included deconstructing 12 existing buildings,19
We found multiple reuse opportunities including using concrete waste for temporary roads and fill for the new campus and recycling ceiling and carpet tiles into new tiles Our Puget Sound project is currently achieving over 90 percent diversion,19
Reducing waste in campuses Last year we began the rollout of recyclable paper visitor badges to Microsoft sites globally which will help avoid seven tons of plastic waste annually Additionally were establishing new programs to reduce food waste other singleuse plastics and virgin finite materials Across Asia sites like Singapore are utilizing sustainable meal boxes to cut down on waste generation Similarly in Japan a new reusable cup initiative launched in July 2020 has completely phased out disposable cups and is estimated to potentially save 960000 paper cups annually Our Istanbul site is using solar powered compost tanks to reduce waste by 1000 kg each month,19
Over the past year our Amsterdam Circular Center model has achieved 83 percent reuse and 17 percent recycling of cloud hardware Based on the success of the pilot were expanding to five additional campuses in the US Boydton Chicago Quincy EMEA Dublin and APAC Singapore regions and extending this model to most of our cloud computing assets This program should achieve 90 percent reuse by 2025 with projected savings of approximately 100 million each year once scaled,15
We also seized opportunities to become more resilient build better ties with communities and increase collaboration with upstream and downstream partners Were bridging the skills divide in our datacenter communities by supporting technical training programs at community colleges vocational schools and other education institutions This work depends on decommissioned and excess datacenter equipment to facilitate the handson labs called Datacenter Academies in datacenter communities,3
Zero waste datacenters Microsoft has a goal to achieve 90 percent diversion of datacenter operational waste by 2030 To reach this goal were working closely with our waste haulers to optimize waste diversion programs across our global datacenter portfolio Were also partnering with thirdparty industry experts to investigate options for hardtorecycle materials such as air filters used in our datacenters Exploring innovative partnerships and solutions to reduce waste and transition to a circular economy are key strategies for achieving our 2030 goal In FY21 we achieved Zero Waste certifications for our San Antonio Texas and Quincy Washington datacenters and renewed certifications for our Boydton Virginia and Dublin Ireland locations,19
Our Puget Sound modernization project is currently achieving over 90 percent construction waste diversion,19
Zero waste for our devices and packaging means taking a circular economy approach to design out waste and keep materials in use longer,19
We are developing opportunities to reuse manufacturing scrap in aluminum production allowing us to use lower carbon 100 percent postindustrial recycled closed loop aluminum for future Surface computer housings For our neodymium magnets a rare earth material we are also exploring postindustrial scrap as a manufacturing feedstock which would enable us to produce 100 percent recycled neodymium in magnets for future products,19
Textiles at Microsoft are normally used on Surface palm rests and type covers However given the unique challenge of the COVID19 pandemic we experimented with scrap Alcantara fabric and repurposed it into a product engineered to be a reusable premium and comfortable threelayer face covering for Microsoft employees,15
Devices Zero waste for our devices and packaging means taking a circular economy approach to design out waste and keep materials in use longer We are extending the lifespan of our devices through programs like Design for Repair we are designing our devices and packaging to use fewer materials and to be increasingly recyclable and we are supporting reuse repair refurbishment and recycling infrastructure to ensure that Microsoft devices are kept in use longer Were also increasing use of recycled material in our own devices accessories and packaging,19
In October 2021 we launched the Ocean Plastic Mouse which has a shell made with 20 percent recycled ocean plastic the first consumer electronics application of this material Going beyond just oceanbound plastic which is plastic that is collected within 50 km from shorelines each mouse contains resin made from recycled water bottles taken directly out of oceans beaches and waterways,19
The launch of the Ocean Plastic Mouse is a small step on our longer journey to use innovative recycled materials The resin is now available for others to use in their own products to help address the global challenge of ocean plastic,15
Over the past year we have used more postconsumer recycled PCR plastics in our products including Surface power supply units Surface devices Xbox consoles and controllers and PC accessories,19
With the new Electric Volt and Daystrike Camo Special Edition controllers we incorporated 30 percent PCR resins into the external housing and 50 percent PCR in the internal midframe for the first time in any Xbox hardware Following in their footsteps came the Aqua Shift controller four variations of the Space Jam New Legacy controllers and our Xbox Design Lab series of controllers These controllers contain a portion of resins made from recycled materials like automotive headlight covers plastic water jugs and CDs Our testing shows the materials provide the same controller durability and performance gamers have come to expect With the relaunch of our Xbox Design Labs we have incorporated the same PCR resins into 75 percent of all Xbox Design Lab controllers,19
Starting in late 2021 Xbox Series S became our first console to incorporate PCR resins into the manufacturing of the body and various internal components To date we have incorporated approximately 28 percent PCR into the products overall design without compromising quality or durability We are now investigating ways to incorporate more PCR into the design along with reducing wall thickness to utilize less material overall,15
The Ocean Plastic Mouse is the first consumer electronics application of recycled ocean plastic,19
Reducing waste in production Traditionally many materials used in the production of devices are made using industrystandard computer numerical control CNC manufacturing With CNC the shape of the product component is cut out of a large block of raw materials after which the excess is discarded To reduce waste in production we have started to introduce material stamping techniques in our manufacturing which instead mold the raw materials to the desired end shape For our new Surface Laptop Studio stamping reduced our manufacturing aluminum scrap rate for the products base by at least 25 percent,19
Enabling repair Repairability and serviceability can extend the lifespan of our devices In 2021 our Design for Repair engineering program helped launch the Surface Pro 8 the Surface Laptop Studio and Surface Laptop SE which are considered to be some of the most repairable devices in their product lines with replaceable displays batteries keyboards and more We have also established a growing Authorized Service Provider ASP network to expand customer repairs across countries including the United States Canada Australia Germany and France We recently partnered with iFixit to offer service tools for Surface devices to iFixit Pro independent repairers Microsoft Authorized Service Providers Microsoft Experience Centers and Microsoft Commercial customers which can be purchased directly from iFixit Our goal is to continue to expand safe secure and sustainable repair options for our Surface and Xbox devices,15

FY21 was a year of progress and learning for Microsoft on our journey to zero waste,19
Implementing circularity activities like purchasing recycled materials offering a service model or keeping materials in use longer can reduce the embodied carbon of materials Circularity plays a key role in reaching our carbon negative commitment to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by half by 2030,15
Circularity still lacks common standards needed to scale,0
Circular economy initiatives do not share a standard method of measurement across industries or product types and may not always accurately represent environmental impact To scale implementation in the long term we need the enabling infrastructure to measure monitor and verify material origin and flows,15
In FY21 we invested to digitize waste data across the company We now have more consistent higherquality data about the amount of waste its type and quality where it is generated and where it goes As we implemented waste data tools across the entire company we saved time collecting and reporting this data from our crosscompany sustainability managers to executive leadership to customers and regulatory bodies,19
Equity and economy are equally important in a circular economy,4
To date the primary focus of a circular economy has been on the economy aspect Equity is equally as important and we need to focus on a just transition for every person organization and community The world must address the disproportionate effects of upstream resource extraction and downstream waste management and pollution It is critical to develop a strategy that ensures underrepresented and under resourced communities are not left behind in the transition to a circular economy,17
Planning for waste interventions must be considered throughout the value chain and by location Upstream decisions like procurement and use of materials affect downstream management and processing of materials as eventual waste Location also affects zero waste implementation and a certain degree of customization can ensure alignment to global efforts while contextualizing the program for local realities While there are best practices that can be shared and replicated on a global scale there are unique characteristics for each campus such as its local infrastructure size or dining services Creating a localized approach to zero waste drives local ownership and program effectiveness while also laddering up to a global target,19
Continue towards zero waste by 2030 We will scale programs such as our Circular Centers and the elimination of singleuse plastics from packaging for Microsoft products and within our supply chain Across the company we are using baseline data to inform annual roadmaps that will result in meaningful environmental outcomes for our employees consumers and the diverse communities in which we operate,19
Build circularity into our contracts We will work upstream to develop better materials including recycled materials and ensure contracts are in place to support circular processes We are also contracting with suppliers to engage in reverse logistics models and take back programs for waste reduction and reuse of packaging materials From downstream waste haulers we are contractually requesting data transparency optimization of services and waste sorting education to promote zero waste outcomes,19
Advance waste data tools Building on our FY21 work to transform our waste accounting we will continue to improve our waste data tools so they more accurately model business activity The ability to forecast environmental impacts will drive upstream sustainable decisionmaking that minimizes waste and associated carbon emissions It will also help us understand the environmental impacts of circularity practices like reuse repair redistribution and recycling We are exploring the best methods to account for this such as measuring the peryear and absolute carbon footprint of a product,19
Increase employee engagement In FY22 as new recycling initiatives are deployed at the Circular Centers we are focused on further iterating operational procedures and training for zero waste practices We are also building design guidelines for engineers that define principles for circular lowcarbon hardware,19
Use our voice to align waste and circularity standards We will help to drive standardization across circularity standards within the Capital Equipment Coalition and use our voice to coalesce industries towards a set of principles to promote circular economy progress There is an opportunity for crossindustry collaboration for waste and circularity data standards including a framework for capturing reliable and consistent data and methodologies,19
Implement circularity to reduce embodied carbon We are continually exploring design changes material selection and business processes to facilitate deep embodied carbon reductions across our operations and products We are analyzing the optimal use of conventional materials such as concrete and steel and pursuing more ambitious opportunities with emerging alternative materials that carry significantly less embodied carbon,15
We are focused on further iterating operational procedures and training for zero waste practices,19
Expand our circular strategy in devices Our work around recycled content repairability recyclability and material efficiency continues to grow Our framework for circularity will account for each phase of the device lifecycle and align with leading industry reporting standards and forthcoming circularity legislation We will also continue expanding programs such as the Microsoft mailback program to ensure consumers around the world have access to an easy convenient and free service for returning their Microsoft branded devices and packaging for reuse refurbishment or recycling By the end of FY22 Microsoft plans to implement the mailback program in 40 countries,15
Scale the circular cloud We are deploying new Circular Centers in Dublin Chicago and Singapore by July 2022 We also plan to launch a Circular Center in Quincy Washington in 2022 followed by Sweden in 2025 Working with our internal and external partners we will develop new dispositions that maximize reuse and minimize waste In addition we are exploring additional circularity functionality such as harvesting for spares and warranty reuse scaling buyback to network hardware and providing recycling support all of which can be performed at the Circular Centers We are also working with our logistics packaging partners to reduce singleuse plastic in packaging and transition to recyclable and compostable packaging,19

Only when we have a massive amount of planetary data and compute at a similar scale can we begin to answer one of the most complex questions ever posedhow do we manage natural resources equitably and sustainably for a prosperous and climate stable future,17
Our commitment protect more land than we use by 2025 and build a Planetary Computer,23
Building a Planetary Computer We will aggregate environmental data from around the world and put it to work through computing and machine learning in a new Planetary Computer,4
Taking responsibility for our land footprint We will take responsibility for the ecosystem impacts of our direct operations by protecting more land than we use by 2025,23
Using our voice on ecosystemrelated public policy issues We will support and advocate for public policy initiatives that measure and manage ecosystems at the national and global scale,23
Empowering partners and customers around the world We will use the Planetary Computer to develop and deploy the digital technology that helps our partners and customers with environmental decisionmaking in their organizational activities,15
A commitment to protect more land than we use and build a Planetary Computer,23
The context Healthy ecosystems are critical for a healthy planet environmental sustainability cant exist without ecosystem sustainability Unhealthy ecosystems created or exacerbated by climate change and biodiversity collapse threaten our entire civilization And yet according to the latest United Nations Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services IPBES8 study the health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than previously thought Put simply we are eroding the very foundations of our economies livelihoods food security health and quality of life worldwide,23
Microsoft recognizes that ecosystems are the thread that connects all our sustainability commitments Ecosystems are where we invest in carbon sequestration projects that help us achieve carbon negativity they are the watersheds we commit to protect and replenish and they are where waste is ultimately diverted We need a strong efficient scalable way to monitor understand measure and ultimately manage the impact of our actions or inactions on ecosystemsboth globally and locally,23
In the past year Microsoft has made considerable progress towards its leading ecosystem commitments of protecting more land than we use and delivering our Planetary Computer to provide access to the worlds critical environmental datasets and to function as a computing platform that enables partners to measure monitor model and manage healthy ecosystems,23
In FY21 we contracted to protect more than 17000 acres of land This puts us on a path to exceed our commitment to protect more land than we use by more than 5000 acres,23
Since its inception in 2017 our AI for Earth program has provided more than 850 grants to organizations working in 110 countries around the world granting more than 20 million in Azure credits,12
The Planetary Computer private preview released as planned in April 2021 with more than 500 users signed up and using the APIs and scalable compute,1
We partnered with subject matter experts to use the power of the Planetary Computer to develop a growing set of applications that enable datadriven decisionmaking for the environment ranging from conservation planning and forest risks to land cover and classification,23
We have made available 24 petabytes of data with more than 30 key environmental and Earth observation datasets to Azure in consistent analysisready format that is freely available for use by anyone,24
Achieving our target of protecting more land than we use by 2025 In FY21 we contracted to protect more than 17200 acres which is 50 percent more than the land we use to operate,23
of total land contracted to protect in FY21 150 percent of land use,23
Protecting ecosystems Taking responsibility for our land footprint,23
Microsoft directly operates on approximately 11000 acres of land around the world and we recognize that our own land footprint has an impact on ecosystems,23
We have made a commitment to permanently protect more land than we use by 2025 We are also looking at ways for our datacenters to integrate and give back to the natural environment,23
Since making this commitment in April 2020 we identified two leading land protection organizations the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation NFWF within the United States and The Nature Conservancy TNC globally to partner with to achieve our commitment to protect more land than we use We used a datainformed approach to identify ecosystems most at risk using TNCs last chance ecosystem framework and NFWFs national landscape conservation framework We also prioritize projects that have the support and involvement of local and indigenous populations,23
In FY21 we contracted for projects that will help protect more than 17000 acres of land including the following,23
TNC Belize Maya Forest Project We contributed to the purchase of the Maya Forest land one of the largest remaining tropical forests in the Americas outside of the Amazon The approximately 236000 acres secures a vital wildlife corridor in Central Americas dwindling forests This area is critical for the protection of iconic wildlife species such as jaguars and ocelots and preserves a significant living carbon reserve,23
NFWF Western Big Game Migration Program We contributed to the purchase of permanent conservation easements in Montana Colorado New Mexico and Nevada that will protect the migration corridors for species of greatest conservation need including mule deer elk bighorn sheep and moose This effort also allows apex predators to thrive including mountain lions grizzly bears and Canada lynx Providing contiguous protected lands is crucial for enabling the successful migration of these wide ranging species,23
Giving back to the natural environment As we expand our operational footprint with new datacenters our approach includes work to find ways for our datacenters to give back to the natural environment Understanding how we can provide the same or better performance as an intact ecosystem starts with understanding how an ecosystem performs on its own We have begun assessment of ecosystem performance in 12 datacenter regions to be completed by end of 2021 Through this research we are quantifying ecosystem performance in terms of services including water quantity and quality air carbon climate soil health human health and wellbeing and biodiversity The goal is to renew and revitalize the surrounding arearesulting in mutual regenerative value for the local community and environment,23
We measure this in percentages of intact ecosystems meaning the higher the percentage the more effective we are at meeting natures benchmark for the area,23
The findings are helping to inform one of our first projects in North Holland which is part of our Amsterdam datacenter region Around the datacenters we will construct lowland forested areas as well as forested wetlands which are highly saturated with water and vegetation suited for water filtration to naturally process storm water and runoff Modeled results from these different approaches suggest that ecosystem performance can be restored to as much as 75 percent where we are able to successfully recreate 75 percent of the function of the untouched ecosystem,23
We will exceed our commitment to protect more land than we use by contracting for more land protection putting us on path to exceed our goal by 50 percent,23
The Maya Forest land is one of the largest remaining tropical forests in the Americas outside of the Amazon,23
We believe that Microsofts most important contribution to protecting ecosystems and biodiversity is delivering the Planetary Computer which provides access to the worlds critical environmental datasets AI and digital technology,23
Our land footprint is relatively small which is why we also focus on using our technology to support ecosystem health,23
We believe that our biggest contribution to the protection of ecosystems is to identify invest in and orchestrate a coherent cloud infrastructure that brings together all relevant stakeholders and offers bestin class sciencedriven tools AI digital catalogs of species distributed computing frameworks and global satellite images We make these tools cloudnative bring our business partners to deploy them to be used and build trust by making visible the science roots and the provenance of the data while creating best practices for deployment by deploying ourselves first We are also embracing open source identifying critical petabytes of satellite images being collected and released as open data including the Copernicus satellite programs and tools like Marxan,23
The manifestation of this work is what we call the Planetary Computer This opensource solution includes data catalogs APIs and applications to empower both data scientists and environmental scientists to craft more effective and informed strategies to protect and restore ecosystems,23
Product In April 2021 we released the Planetary Computer which enables globalscale environmental monitoring by combining petabytes of data and spatial analysis tools to power sustainability applications It is a platform that lets users build on the power of the cloud to accelerate environmental sustainability and Earth science,3
The Planetary Computer consists of four major components,4
24 petabytes of data about Earth systems hosted on Azure and made available to users for free,1
APIs that allow users to search for the data they need,22
across space and time Instead of sifting through millions of files we index content so any user can ask,1
directly for a type of data for example give me all data from these satellites for Kansas in summer 2020 when it was not cloudy and give me those times on a specific map projection of the average values This vastly reduces the complexity of dealing with petabytes of data,24
that allows scientists to process massive geospatial datasets To date we have seamlessly deployed more than 20000 cluster node workers to support our user workloads,11
that put the Planetary Computer platform to work for environmental sustainability ranging from conservation planning and forest risk management to land cover classification,23
The Sentinel2 program provides global imagery in 13 spectral bands and a revisit time of five days,24
We have made available 24 petabytes of data with more than 30 key environmental and Earth observation datasets,24
The Planetary Computer uses opensource tools and supports open standards In fact the foundation of the Planetary Computer is the incredible ecosystem of tools being developed in the open by our partners and the much broader opensource community For example our Hub builds on the work done by the Pangeo community to put the tools of data science to work for the Earth science community and our API builds on the work done by the STAC community to streamline and standardize the cataloging and discovery of geospatial data,12
The Planetary Computer API and Planetary Computer Hub are currently in private preview accepting a small set of early users with plans to go public in mid2022 All the datasets are available and can be accessed via Azure Blob Storage Datasets can be used by developers working within or outside of our Planetary Computer Hub They can integrate each component in their existing processes or use the full Planetary Computer with one single experience,1

The volume and variety of spatial data continues to grow exponentially,4
Finding and sharing data about the Earth remains a huge challenge,22
Whether its satellites in the sky or sensors on the ground data about the Earth is being captured at higher resolutions more often with a variety of data formats and purposes There is also a growing set of model output and derived products which are large spatial datasets themselves valuable to a broad set of use cases This creates a deluge of data waiting to be unlocked for positive environmental sustainability impact,3
Data providers are eager to make their data more accessible for environmental sustainability use cases,22
The organizations that are producing spatial data know whats at stake for our ecosystems They want to see their data utilized to meet the sustainability challenges we are facing and work together to enable users to utilize the data in a common interoperable manner,1
Getting data to the cloud is the only way to scale the work of a broad range of users,1
Data that exists in the cloud has a huge advantage over data that must be first downloaded on a users system Unless you own a supercomputing system there is no way to download and compute over the vast amount of data needed to scale the analyses and operationalization of that data,1
Users need to search the vast amount of data available to find the data they need and have easy access to data in the areas and times they care about Just because data is available does not mean it is accessible There is a growing effort in the geospatial community to enable access to cloudhosted data through utilizing cloud optimized formats and supplying APIs to search through standardsbased metadata,1
Open data open source open science and open standards are critical to collaboration,12
The scope of the problems facing our world mean that no one organization or person will be able to solve them The easier it is for governments academia and industry to work together the faster we can all move in the same direction The best mechanism currently for this collaboration is doing things in the open publishing open datasets using and investing in opensource software publishing open science and making data accessible through open standards,12
