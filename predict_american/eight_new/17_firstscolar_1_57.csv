In 2016 we set a fiveyear goal for 2021 to reduce our greenhouse gas GHG,25
emissions intensity per watt produced by 45 compared to our 2008 baseline,21
Since 2008 our companywide carbon intensity decreased by approximately,18
77 as a result of increased module efficiency manufacturing throughput,24
and capacity utilization decreased emissions intensity of purchased grid,24
electricity along with energy conservation and low carbon initiatives In 2020,24
GHG emissions intensity decreased by 31 and our absolute scope 1 and,25
scope 2 GHG emissions decreased by 25 compared to 2019 primarily,25
due to the greater throughput and enhanced energy efficiency of our Series,24

First Solar is committed to driving down our carbon footprint even as we,25
continue to increase our manufacturing capacity and module throughput After,24
surpassing our 2021 intensitybased target three years early we have set,12
new sciencebased targets to reduce our absolute scope 1 and scope 2 GHG,25
emissions by 20 by 2028 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050 relative,25
to 2020 We also aim to reduce our GHG emissions intensity by 93 by 2028,25
from a 2008 baseline These targets are in line with sciencebased climate,13
goals to limit the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius,13
WB2C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 15 degrees Celsius above pre,25
industrial levels We aim to achieve this through increased energy efficiency,24
going 100 renewable across our US operations by 2026 working on,24
enabling the offsite solar market in Malaysia and Vietnam and purchasing,4
bundled RECs and offsets as a last resort,12
In 2020 we joined RE100 and committed to powering our global operations,3
with 100 renewable energy by 2028 We have installed onsite PV installations,24
at our production sites in Ohio and Malaysia and at our recycling facility in,15
Frankfurt Oder Germany We are now investigating opportunities to procure,4
offsite solar electricity as part of our renewable energy strategy,24
In 2020 our manufacturing energy intensity energy consumption per watt,24
produced decreased by approximately 19 compared to 2019 primarily due,24
to the greater throughput and enhanced energy efficiency of our Series 6,24
manufacturing process In 2021 we set a target to improve global energy,15
efficiency per watt produced by 74 by 2028 from a 2009 baseline or by,24
First Solars manufacturing energy intensity includes all processes from,24
the beginning of our manufacturing process to finished module Increased,15
and energy conservation initiatives have enabled us to cut our manufacturing,24
energy intensity per watt by more than 60 since 2009,24
Since 2009 First Solars manufacturing water intensity water consumption,20
per watt produced decreased by 68 due to significant improvements in,24
module efficiency manufacturing throughput and the implementation of,24
water conservation and recycling projects in our manufacturing and recycling,20
operations In 2020 First Solars manufacturing water intensity decreased,20
by approximately 12 due to the increased throughput and efficiency of,24
our Series 6 manufacturing process as well as water recycling initiatives In,20
total we saved more than 290 million liters of water in 2020 equivalent to,20
While our production increased by 7 in 2020 our absolute water withdrawals,20
decreased by approximately 5 due to the enhanced throughput and water,20
efficiency of our Series 6 manufacturing process as well as water recycling,20
initiatives We continue to review water consumption patterns down to the unit,20
operation level in our manufacturing process and are challenging our process,15
engineers to deliver additional water savings We have set a target to achieve,20
a 71 reduction in water usage per watt produced by 2028 from a 2009,20
baseline Since 2018 all routinely operated First Solar recycling facilities in,19
the US Germany Malaysia and Vietnam generate zero wastewater discharge,20
under normal operations Instead the wastewater is recycled and converted,20
into freshwater which can then be reused in the recycling process,20
We monitor and measure 100 of the water discharges from our manufacturing,20
recycling and research and development facilities In 2020 approximately,15
37 or 1353 megaliters of First Solars total water withdrawn from water,20
utilities 3655 megaliters was discharged as wastewater from our industrial,20
wastewater treatment systems Approximately 76 of our wastewater was,20
sent to a thirdparty municipal wastewater facility and approximately 24 was,20
discharged directly to fresh surface water river First Solar treats wastewater,20
at our manufacturing and recycling facilities using a batch discharge system,19
Once treated the water is collected in holding tanks which are sampled and,20
tested to confirm compliance with regulatory limits before being discharged,12
No industrial wastewater leaves our site unless we have tested and approved,20
it for discharge even if it is being discharged to a municipal wastewater,20
treatment plant If the water contaminant levels are above the permitted,20
discharge limit it is sent for retreatment internally,20
First Solars manufacturing waste generation intensity grams per watt,19
produced has decreased by nearly 80 since 2009 as a result of increased,24
module and manufacturing efficiency combined with recycling and waste,19
minimization projects In 2020 our manufacturing waste intensity increased,19
slightly by 1 due to production downtime for retooling at our facility in,17
This graph depicts First Solars absolute manufacturing waste produced in,19
metric tons with a percentage breakdown by type and destination Absolute,24
waste generation increased in 2020 by approximately 8 primarily due to the,19
First Solar is committed to reducing and recycling hazardous waste in line,19
with our environmental management system objectives of minimizing waste,19
and preventing pollution Since 2012 we have reduced our hazardous waste,19
generation per watt produced by more than 40,24
Hazardous waste is classified according to the definition used by the countries,19
in which we operate eg under the Environmental Quality Scheduled Wastes,19
Regulations in Malaysia Law No 552014QH13 on Environmental Protection,23
in Vietnam and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the US,23
This graph depicts waste recycled and disposed by First Solars manufacturing,19
and recycling facilities in Ohio Malaysia and Vietnam The data includes,1
modules that we recycle onsite both manufacturing line scrap and modules,19
returned from the field along with many other manufacturing byproducts that,24
are recycled The data does not include modules that are being recycled at our,24
The amount of waste disposed increased in 2018 and 2019 due to the,19
decommissioning of Series 4 manufacturing equipment and the ramp in,5
production Increasing recycling capacity and moving to 247 recycling helped,15
improve the percentage of waste recycled in 2020 Overall of the total,19
material First Solar sends offsite more than 80 is sent for beneficial reuse,24
The material recovery rate of First Solars stateoftheart module recycling,19
process remains unchanged We continue to recover more than 90 of the,12
semiconductor material more than 90 of other metals and 90 of the,19
glass from recycled First Solar modules The glass cullet is reused in new,15
glass products and the unrefined semiconductor material is sent for further,15
processing to be reused in new First Solar modules In Malaysia our laminate,15
material is being recycled for reuse in products such as rubber mats bicycle,15
handles and shoe soles thereby further closing the loop on our products life,15

Supply Chain Overview Our thin film module manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types,17
of raw materials and components to produce a solar module Critical raw,15
materials and components in our manufacturing process include CdTe,15
front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide organics such as,24
photo resist tempered back glass frames packaging components such as,15
interlayer cord platecord plate cap cables and solar connectors,24
First Solar has a global set of specifications for the materials used in our,15
products which results in a tightly controlled supply chain with unrivalled,17
traceability and quality products We also own and operate the facilities,15
which manufacture our modules turning a sheet of glass into a completed,15
module all under one roof In contrast many traditional tier one crystalline,18
silicon PV manufacturers have multiple products processes and bill of,15
