To reduce the carbon footprint of our productswe are increasing efficiency and transitioningto materials from recycled sources and thosemade using lowcarbon energy In 2021 wecontinued to improve the carbon efficiency ofthe integrated circuits we use in our products components we have prioritized because theyare carbonintensive For example switchingto the Apple M1 chip for the 13inch MacBookPro reduced the energy needed to manufactureand use the device driving down the productscarbon footprint by over 8 percent,15,24,diff,,,

To minimize the carbon footprint of our products we seek to create less waste in the processing of materialsreduce machining time and the associated energy used more efficiently transform material into the shapeswe need and maximize recovery and reprocessing of manufacturing scrap,19,24,diff,,,
prioritized the use of aluminum smelted usinglowcarbon sources of electricity rather thanfossil fuels  for a lower carbon impact Thesechanges alone have decreased the carbonemissions associated with our use of aluminumby 68 percent since 2015,24,21,diff,,,
Product energy use accounts for 22 percentof our gross carbon footprint  and has animpact on the individual energy use of eachof our customers By addressing this in theearliest phases of design we have cut the productenergy use across all major product lines bymore than 70 percent since 2008 throughenergy efficiency improvements3In fiscalyear 2021 over 99 percent of Apples eligibleproducts by revenue received an ENERGYSTAR rating for superior energy efficiency4And over 99 percent of Apples eligibleproducts by revenue met the requirementsfor EPEAT registration5,24,24,,,,
We are focused on using less energy acrossour operations beginning with how we designoperate and maintain our facilities And wecontinue these same efforts into our supplychain which benefits the communities whereour suppliers operate Drawing less energy fromelectrical grids  many of which still rely heavilyon fossil fuels  helps reduce local air pollutionand improve air quality for nearby communities,21,21,,,,
The emissions from manufacturing our productsaccount for about 70 percent of Apples grosscarbon footprint We launched our Supplier EnergyEfficiency Program in 2015 with the goal of helpingsuppliers optimize their facilities and operationsto use as little energy as possible We provideguidance designed to help suppliers uncoveropportunities for energy efficiency Suppliers inour Supplier Energy Efficiency Program avoidedmore than 1150000 annualized metric tons ofsupply chain carbon emissions in fiscal year 2021,24,24,,,,
This past year we intensified our efforts to reduce Applesemissions In fiscal year 2021 we avoided over 23 millionmetric tons of emissions across all scopes Initiatives thatweve been growing for years  like sourcing 100 percentrenewable electricity for our facilities transitioning suppliersto clean energy and using lowcarbon materials in products yielded indisputable results,24,21,diff,,,
Thanks to this work we have begun to decouple businessgrowth from emissions While our revenue grew 33 percentour emissions grew by less than 5 percent To mitigate thisincrease in emissions we applied an additional 06 milliontons of renewable energy credits RECs and 05 millionmetric tons of carbon offsets to proportionally coverelectricity use and direct emissions respectively across ourvalue chain This represents a shortterm bridging solutionas we grow our carbon reduction programs to meet thescale of the challenge,25,25,,,,
