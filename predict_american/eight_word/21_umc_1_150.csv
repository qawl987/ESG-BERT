132  Risk Management and Countermeasures,"18
"
UMC identifies key risks and formulates countermeasures in four areas strategy operation finance and hazard It also includes important risks related to the companys operations on environmental social or corporate governance issues In addition in terms of emerging risks the growth of Taiwan’s semiconductor industry outpaces the global average Driven by factors such as continued development of new process technology and clustering effects of peripheral equipment and material suppliers UMC is optimistic that the competitive advantage and growth potential of Taiwan’s semiconductor industry will remain a global leader in the next few years The political or economic tensions between major countries in the world have even led to trade wars in recent years green energy policies may cause investment and operation pressure and climate change etc all of which will bring impacts as well as opportunities that cannot be overlooked As a link in the supply chain UMC also pays attention to the global risk situation in addition to the emerging risks of the industry and refers to the Global Risk Report published by the World Economic Forum WEF every year to understand how risk trends are evolving and to start risk response measures as early as possible,"18
"
Regarding risks such as information security natural disaster prevention and climate change the specific sections are provided to explain the content of the response The remaining major risks and emerging risks in 2020 are as follows,"13
"
Tension in Political or Economic Relations between Major Countries Cause Potential Impact to Company,"12
"
Risk DescriptionInternationally due to political or economic tensions between major countries national power has been exerted to penalize specific entities or even trigger a trade war The main methods include raising tariffs embargoes policy interventions government subsidies etcSuch tensions or trade wars seem to be difficult to resolve in the short run,"12
"
Potential ImpactThe impact on UMC includes revenue delivery and business reputation For example a sharp increase in tariffs in importing countries may drive up endmarket prices thereby reducing consumer purchase demand and further reducing UMC customer orders The United States Export Control Act regulates that if those whose content originating from the United States exceeds a certain ratio their products may not be exported to specific countries This may affect UMCs direct or indirect supply to specific customers  Restrictions on the export of hightech materials may affect UMCs production resulting in failure to deliver on time and damage to business reputation,"15
"
CountermeasuresIncreases the diversification of customers’ region and product application Besides cautiously facing existing business in North America and the Asia Pacific UMC also aggressively expands its business from other regions such as Europe and Japan In addition to the company’s original business in server automotive and industrial applications UMC also has active efforts aimed at expanding its opportunities in 5G IoT AI etc,"15
"
Monitors and evaluates the impact of external changes including global regulations politics economic conditions etc on the Companys business raw materials customer demand etc and takes necessary risk response measures In practice a raw material supply chain tracking mechanism is established and the legal compliance response system is strengthened Through a more accurate grasp of the countrys component ratio of raw materials UMC can analyze the possible impacts and respond in a timely manner,"17

Analyze and grasp the direction of changes in crossstrait laws and regulations and timely adjust management processes and operation directions,"12
"
New M  A Fabs Cannot Create Production Synergy,"4
"
Currency Exchange and Interest Rate Risk,"18
"
Risk DescriptionThe company pursues continuous growth and provides better wafer foundry services to local customers Therefore mergers and acquisitions are one of the companys important growth strategies However the new MA fabs may not be able to fully achieve the expected production synergy due to factors such as differences in the corporate culture or management methods of both parties difficult integration of production processes or system differences,"3
"
Potential ImpactThe new MA fab cannot achieve the expected merger synergy for some reasons which may affect the achievement of the company’s overall performance goals and even affect the company’s longterm growth strategy For example cultural differences and communication barriers can reduce company productivity differences in operation flows and systems may delay in the transfer of new process and new product,"15
"
Risk Description and Potential ImpactRevenue and capital expenditure in the semiconductor industry is mainly calculated in currencies other than NT and hence fluctuates with exchange ratesDue to large exposure of deposits and loans in the semiconductor industry changes in interest rates could result in deviations from expected financial performance,"18
"
CountermeasuresUMC balances foreign currency assets and liabilities by natural hedging In addition appropriate management of debt period and fixed or floating interest rate structure reduces interest rate risk,"18
"
CountermeasuresA dedicated task force is established to ensure the smooth integration of the new MA fab The Company pays attention to crossnational cultural differences and establishes a communication channel at the beginning to build full trust between the employees and customers of the acquisition target,"10

"
In 2018 UMCs application for Emission Reduction Methodology for Semiconductor Industry Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases and N2O Abatement Technology was reviewed and approved by the EPA and published on Taiwans Greenhouse Gas Registry platform UMC also applied for the GHG Offset Project which was approved by the EPA in 2020 to reserve carbon assets in accordance with Taiwan’s regulations on voluntary greenhouse gas reduction incentive mechanism under review According to our estimation UMC can build carbon assets of more than 22 million tons in 10 years,"25
"
UMC has a stateoftheart 300mm wafer fab in Singapore The Singapore government announced that it will introduce a carbon tax from 2019 onwards making it the first country in Southeast Asia to promote this measure In Taiwan there are additional sublaws to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act and a revised Renewable Energy Development Act that stipulate fines for Greenhouse Gas GHG emissions exceeding the total controlled amount and either mandatory green electricity certification purchase or payment for inadequate proportion of green electricity use,"25
"
At present UMC has transformed the carbon emissions into potential carbon costs based on the analysis of the carbon risk scenarios of each fab and has actively carried out a phased GHG reduction plan The measures for the use of clean energy include the reduction of raw materials setting of highefficiency GHG breakdown equipment etc and building solar energy systems The company takes an aggressive stance in reducing the impact of carbon emissions and taxes enhancing its operational competitive advantage In addition UMC has organized interfab competitions such as the Green Fab Award and the Green Innovation Award to encourage plants to implement energysaving and GHG reduction measures Bonus incentives are available to business units and individuals which have achieved good results in reducing carbon emissions,"25
"
In order to eliminate the environmental impact from Greenhouse effect and minimize energy consumption UMC set companywide carbon reduction goals and development plans through the CS Committeeto coordinate and integrate departmental energy saving and carbon reduction strategies and programs Regular committee meetings are heldto review the implementation outcome and to introduce energy conservation technologies and implement energy efficiency improvement programs in all facilities In addition to energy management strategies including energy saving implementation increasing energy efficiency and expanding renewable energy installation UMC also promotes the implementation of energy management in its offices and commonareas with promotional activities education and training to cultivate a mindset and habit of energy conservation and GHG emission reduction among employees,"24
