More than 30 years ago MAC created Back 2 MAC a pioneering take back program intended to help reduce the environmental impact of the brands packaging by recovering and recycling where possible its iconic black acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ABS plastic packages Through the program which operates in select markets we partner with local vendors to help recover and recycle clean empty MAC packaging what cannot be recycled is converted to energy,"15
"
In fiscal 2022 MAC expanded the program in our EMEA region to include Austria Belgium Czech Republic Greece and Poland In EMEA our vendor can recycle select ABS plastic into new plastic that is used in the production of coffee machines and IT equipment among other items In North America our vendors support MAC with a closedloop system to recycle select ABS packaging into material that can be used for new MAC compacts In North America MAC enabled the processing of more than 340000 pounds of empty packages in fiscal 2022,"15
"
We continue to strengthen our network of companies universities and consortia to advance our collective approach to packaging innovation For example in fiscal 2022 we joined a consortium with five other personal care products companies facilitated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT to assess the abilities of materials recovery facilities to handle small materials and packages As part of the twoyear consortium we aim to support MITs research to develop new strategies for the mechanical recycling of small format objects,"15
"
We have also added several other new industry initiatives and partnerships to our existing relationships and have joined the steering committee of the Sustainable Packaging Initiative for CosmEtics SPICE where we help guide the content for the organizations quarterly meetings,"15
"
In fiscal 2022 we became the exclusive partner of the International Space Stations ISS National Laboratory Sustainability Challenge Beyond Plastics program The challenge solicited USbased proposals for applied research  and technology development concepts targeting one of the following goals,"12
"
  Seek alternative feedstocks and pathways for polymer production beyond ,"17
"
The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Cape Canaveral Florida hosted presentations from the finalists in March 2022 who were then invited to submit a full flight project proposal leveraging the ISS National Lab,"3
