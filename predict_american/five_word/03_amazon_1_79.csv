Every day at Amazon we ask ourselves How can we make this product this service or this experience better for our customers We continually seek ways to challenge ourselves and improve how we deliver for our customers support our employees and accelerate the pace of innovation This mindset is ingrained in our culture so every day we apply the same relentless pursuit to delivering progress on our sustainability commitments,15
The journey to become more sustainable is not simple or straightforward for any organization For a company of the size and broad scope of Amazon its a big challenge But at Amazon we dont shy away from big challenges We innovate and create We dont have all the answers today but we believe in the need to act now,3
This is reflected in one of our newest Leadership Principles introduced last year Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility It says that we are big we impact the world and we are far from perfect We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions Our local communities planet and future generations need us to be better every day We apply our Leadership Principles dailywhether we are discussing ideas for new inventions or deciding on the best approach to solve a problem Throughout 2021 we embedded the spirit of this Leadership Principle into our everyday actions and continued to make progress on our environmental and social commitments,10
Delivering Progress for the Planet,10
In 2019 we cofounded The Climate Pledge and made a commitment to achieve netzero carbon by 204010 years ahead of the Paris Agreement We invited others to join us and there are now more than 300 businesses and organizations across 51 industries and 29 countries that have signed the Pledge which means we are collectively coming at the climate crisis from nearly every sector and nearly every angle,13
diverse representation in our workforce at the most senior levels Weve helped more than 70000 Amazon employees learn new skills and advance their careers as part of our Upskilling 2025 pledge and we are enabling thousands of hourly employees in 14 countries to earn certificates and degrees through Amazon Career Choice Earlier this year we also expanded travel reimbursements for our employees in the US to cover treatment for nonlifethreatening medical issues when travel is required including elective abortion and infertility starting in 2022,8
As part of our efforts to decarbonize our business we became the worlds largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in 2020 and last year we reached 85 renewable energy across our business We continue to expand our use of zeroemission transportation such as electric delivery vans cargo bikes and onfoot deliveries and in 2021 more than 100 million packages were delivered to our customers doorsteps globally using zeroemission vehicles We are also investing in naturebased solutions and last year we helped to create the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance LEAF Coalitiona global initiative of governments and leading companies that has already mobilized 1 billion to protect the worlds tropical rainforests We will continue to act boldly to address climate change and to invest in solutions to help meet our commitment to reach netzero carbon across our operations by 2040,13
Our ability to be a force for change on behalf of our planet relies on diverse perspectives from smart passionate and committed people from all backgrounds In 2021 we continued to make progress on our diversity goals including increasing the number of Black directors and vice presidents by almost 70 and we remain committed to increasing,8
In our communities we are supporting initiatives to address the affordable housing crisisincluding a commitment of more than 2 billion from the Amazon Housing Equity Fund launched last year As of March 2022 these commitments have already preserved or created 8000 affordable units to house more than 18000 people Also last yearin service to people in our communities and supply chainwe signed the United Nations UN Womens Empowerment Principles which offers businesses guidance on ways to promote gender equity in the workplace and global community we created a 150 million Black Business Accelerator program in partnership with our Black Employee Network affinity group and we launched a 12 million fiveyear partnership with the US National Safety Council to uncover new ways to prevent and address musculoskeletal disorders,9
Since the beginning of Russias invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 we quickly mobilized to provide humanitarian aid and assistance to the people of Ukraine including financial and inkind donations cloud computing credits resettlement support and more We are proud of how our global teams came together to support this effort and are honored to have been awarded the Ukraine Peace Prize for the support AWS has shown the Ukraine government and the Ukrainian people,5
We are proud of the progress weve made but we recognize we have more to do Our everyday actions to deliver progress are in service of achieving longterm systemic change that improves the wellbeing of people communities and the planet,10
The path to achieving some of our goals will be long and complex but we are not deterred At Amazon we thrive on pushing the boundaries of whats possible We are taking the same tenacity we use to invent and problem solve for our customers and applying it to how we help address some of the worlds biggest challenges I hope you enjoy learning more about how we are doing this as you read our 2021 Sustainability Report,3

The AWS Diagnostic Development Initiative DDI twoyear 20 million commitment to accelerate research and innovation to advance the collective understanding and detection of COVID19 and other infectious diseases in order to mitigate current and future outbreaks,5
From March through early December 2021 we hosted more than 1800 onsite vaccination events for frontline employees We also launched the Max Your Vax sweepstakes to encourage our frontline operations employees to get vaccinated We offered a variety of weekly prizesincluding two 500000 grand prizes six 100000 cash prizes five new vehicles valued at 40000 each and five vacations each valued at 12000 that included 40 hours of paid time off,9
Empowering Customers to Manage Health and Safety,9
Throughout the pandemic we have invested billions of dollars in the health and safety of our employees and customers including building an inhouse COVID19 testing program to ensure frontline employees have access to free regular testing in the US and the UK,9
An international team of scientists from the Serratus project built a powerful supercomputer on AWS The supercomputer searched almost 6 million publicly available biological samples for the presence of RNA viruses in less than two weeks for 24000achieving what would have taken a standard computer well over 2000 years and cost at least 10 times more Through this process the research team used the AWS Cloud to identify more than 130000 new RNA viruses including nine new coronaviruses creating a global viral surveillance system that could help prevent future pandemics,1
By January 2021 our national COVID19 testing lab located in Kentucky processed more than 1 million COVID19 tests for frontline employees from more than 700 testing sites and provided access to COVID19 testing to nearly all frontline employees At the height of the pandemic our labs were processing more than 30000 tests each day,2
In early 2021 Amazon took immediate action to help address the COVID19 surge in India We utilized our global logistics network to purchase airlift and deliver medical equipment identified as critically needed by the government of India and local charities,5
In the first phase of the AWS DDI AWS supported 87 organizations in 17 countries ranging from nonprofits and research institutions to startups and large businesses AWS awarded 8 million to support a range of diagnostic projects including molecular tests for antibodies antigens and nucleic acids diagnostic imaging wearables and data analytics tools that use artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect COVID19,2
In April 2021 AWS launched the next phase and broadened the Initiatives scope to three new areas 1 early disease detection to identify outbreaks at the individual and at the community level 2 prognosis to better understand disease trajectory and 3 public health genomics to bolster viral genome sequencing worldwide,18
Helping Employees Get Back to Work,10
We took what we learned from this process to create our own athome COVID19 test collection kit The tests received Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration in June 2021 providing an affordable reliable and convenient way for customers to test for COVID19 at home The kits are processed by Amazons inhouse laboratory using the diagnostic approach recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,2
We worked with industry partners and nongovernmental organizations NGOs to deliver more than 8000 oxygen concentrators and 500 BiPAP machines to India This medical equipment was donated to hospitals and public institutions to increase their capacity to help COVID19infected patients across multiple cities We also joined the US Chamber of Commerces Global Task Force on Pandemic Response to deliver ventilators to India In Nepal Amazon teamed up with the UN World Food Programme to donate and deliver supplies to communities affected by COVID19 including 850000 personal protective items,5
When the time came for employees to start returning to corporate offices we engaged with our teams to find out what kind of flexibility they needed to keep everyone safe rather than specifying a onesizefitsall approach for all business units We encouraged leaders to determine how many days their team members would be in the office and which days those would be so long as that decision was guided by what would be most effective for our customers and safest for our employees Some teams continue working mostly remotely others work a combination of remotely and in the office and others work mostly in the office,9
Environment Investing in Positive Impact,10
Operating sustainably is no longer a choice its an imperative Making meaningful progress to address climate change takes unprecedented action across all industries and societies Amazon recognizes this and acknowledges that the ways we do business have impacts far beyond our own company Theres no time to waste and thats why we are investing in efforts to protect the environments of the people and communities we serveboth now and in the future,13

Climate change is one of the worlds greatest crises and to address it the public and private sectors need to act together Thats why we cofounded The Climate Pledge a commitment to reach netzero carbon by 204010 years ahead of the Paris Agreement Since we created the Pledge in 2019 more than 300 companies have joined Amazon in making this commitment,13
The path to decarbonization remains challenging This is especially true for a business of the size and broad scope of Amazon We operate businessesdelivery and transportation logistics physical stores grocery manufacturing and cloud computing servicesthat involve moving products manufacturing goods and creating computing capacity all at scale While some of these businessesincluding cloud computing and ecommerce offer greater efficiencies some are more carbonintensive endeavors In reducing their carbon footprint through investment and innovation we will enable even greater efficiency and moresustainable choices for our customers,15
As we work to decarbonize our company Amazon is growing rapidly We have scaled our business at an unprecedented pace to help meet the needs of our customers through the pandemic From early 2020 to the end of 2021 we created more than 750000 fulltime and parttime jobs worldwide and doubled the size of the fulfillment network that we had built over the previous 25 years At the same time an increasing number of companies around the world moved their technology to the cloud gaining significant speed innovation and cost advantages and AWS grew its revenue by 37 yearoveryear in 2021,3
These developments meant we had to build new facilities for both our consumer and cloud businessesand expand our transportation network Throughout this growth we remained focused on improving our efficiency through moresustainable solutions including electric vehicles and alternative fuel options as well as wind and solar power across our network In AWS the team spent considerable resource innovating on power efficiency removing the central Uninterruptible Power Supply from our data center,24
design integrating power supplies into our racks and utilizing Graviton EC2 instances that use up to 60 less energy for the same performance than comparable Amazon EC2 instances,24
With all of our growth in 2021 our absolute carbon emissions increased by 18 in 2021 however importantly our carbon intensity decreased by 19this is the third year in a row weve seen our carbon intensity decrease This measurement quantifies total carbon emissions in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent COe per dollar of gross merchandise sales GMS As companies invest in new products and services and their businesses grow substantially the focus should not be solely on a companys carbon footprint in terms of absolute carbon emissions but also on whether its lowering its carbon intensity Over time continued decreases in carbon intensity can lead to lower absolute emissions See the Appendix,25
While weve had success cutting emissions from some operations we are still early in the process of transforming others Some actions and investments have immediate carbon savings while others will take years to demonstrate results The path to netzero carbon has many obstacles but we thrive on big challenges A few of those big challenges include,25
Powering our operations with 100 renewable energy,24
Developing moresustainable transportation infrastructure Constructing moresustainable buildings Decarbonizing the supply chain,17
Powering Operations With 100 Renewable Energy,24
In 2021 we reached 85 renewable energy across our operations and we are on a path to achieve 100 by 2025five years ahead of the original target of 2030 This transition to 100 renewable energy benefits our customers as well Studies by the international analyst firm 451 Research found that moving onpremises computing workloads to AWS can lower workload carbon footprint by nearly 80 compared to surveyed enterprise data centers That number could improve to as high as 96 once AWS is powered with 100 renewable energya target we are on path to meet by 2025 AWS infrastructure is 36 times more energy efficient than the median of surveyed US enterprise data centers and up to five times more energy efficient than the average European enterprise data center,24
technologies Amazons Climate Pledge Funda corporate venture fund that invests in sustainabilityrecently announced it has invested in EH2 in the US and Sunfire in Germany two companies helping to push the green hydrogen industry forward,13
renewable energy through a combination of offsite and onsite solar projects And we plan to achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED Platinum certification the highest sustainability building certification issued by the US Green Building Council,24
It will take time to remove carbon emissions from heavy transportation systems including ocean shipping aviation and trucking Governments and the private sector need to come together on this important work Amazon is at the heart of such industry initiatives and government partnerships including the Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels network coZEV the First Movers Coalition the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance Aviators Group SABA and the Clean Energy Demand Initiative,21
We also continue to innovate with construction techniques to make our fulfillment centers more sustainable Many of our fulfillment facilities throughout the US Europe and India are powered by onsite solar where a rooftop installation can power up to 80 of the facilitys energy use As of 2021 115 of our global fulfillment facilities have rooftop solar installations,24
Constructing our AWS data centers also presents challenges related to sustainability Concrete and steel used in construction are two of the largest contributors of embodied carbon in a data center building and we have multiple initiatives to reduce their carbon impact For example our design standards now require concrete with a 20 reduction in embodied carbon compared with standard concrete for new US data centers and we are expanding this requirement globally Also instead of using steel from oxygen furnaces that burn coal or gas we are moving to steel from electricarc furnaces which use scrap steel and can create steel using renewable energy and up to 100 recycled content In 2021 six AWS data centers were constructed with steel made this way and we have plans to build more in the future,24
Reducing carbon emissions in transportation is a complex challenge for many companies We plan to make half of our shipments netzero carbon by 2030 and to do that we are creating a worldwide fleet of zeroemission vehicles Right now the vehicles and charging infrastructure dont exist at the scale needed to serve customers We need the supply to increase dramatically We have ordered 100000 electric vehicles EVs from Rivian and thousands more from manufacturers such as MercedesBenz Stellantis and Mahindra Electric These orders have sent a demand signal that is shifting the market to meet not only our needs but also the needs of other companies around the world,25
Businesses also face the challenge of removing carbon emissions from new building construction Via The Climate Pledge Fund Amazon has invested in CarbonCure Technologies which enables concrete producers to make the same highquality concrete with a lower carbon footprint and Brimstone Energy which seeks to make cement carbon neutral through a process focused on calcium silicate rocks which have no embedded CO2 as well as magnesium species which passively absorb CO2 Amazon is lowering the carbon footprint of our buildings by using CarbonCures systems and Brimstone Energy cement in some new construction including in Amazons second headquarters in Virginia HQ2,25
We announced in November that in the city of Paris twothirds of our shipments are delivered using zero emission transport such as EVs electric cargo bikes and onfoot deliveries We also are exploring green hydrogen,21
HQ2 will be a model for sustainable construction Weve electrified the operations of HQ2 eliminating the use of fossil fuels for buildings systems and food service We have committed to powering 100 of HQ2s operations with,24
We Thrive on Big Challenges,18
Amazon utilizes an extensive supply chain to deliver goods and services to our customers Our carbon accounting process addresses all three Scopes of emissions under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Since 2019 we have shared the Scope 1 2 and 3 emissions included in our footprint through our annual Sustainability Report along with a detailed description of the comprehensive methodology underlying our calculations,25
Measurement is critical as we work toward our goal of net zero carbon by 2040we have to measure and understand emissions in order to eliminate them Like other companies we are working to improve the granularity of data available and will continue to seek improvements to our reporting processes We already work with organizations and regulatory bodies around the globe to promote transparent and comparable climate reporting,12
One example of this is through our partnership with the We Mean Business Coalition a group of nonprofits focused on accelerating the transition to a netzero economy We support the Coalitions SME Climate Huba global initiative that gives small and mediumsized enterprises like those in our supply chain free tools and resources to measure and report their emissions With the Hubs support these companies are committing to halve their emissions by 2030 and to reach netzero by 2050,17
The challenges we collectively face on the path to netzero carbon are considerable Many new technologies are showing promise in their ability to reduce carbon emissions but may still require significant development We need to both invent new solutions and scale and drive down the costs of known solutions,25
In 2021 we reached 85 renewable energy across our operations and we are on a path to achieve 100 by 2025five years ahead of the original target of 2030 Progress is not easy and we are far from done However our success in deploying renewable energy globally provides us with a playbook that we are deploying to tackle big challenges like transportation building construction and supply chain decarbonization strategies With our relentless culture of innovation and a tenacious team of sustainability scientists and professionals we are committed to reaching our 2040 target,24
But we cant do it alone We will continue to work with partners in the public and private sectors to drive innovation technology advancements and global policy change To the public sector we say We support and encourage policies and publicprivate partnerships that will help accelerate climate solutions And as one of more than 300 signatories to The Climate Pledge we say to the innovators scientists builders and entrepreneurs Our door is open We all need to decarbonize The work may not make the headlines or bring immediate rewards but a challenge like this will never be resolved overnight These are the hard steps that need to be taken We welcome you to join us in finding solutions to this global crisis,13

In 2021 more than 100 million packages were delivered to our customers doorsteps across Europe with a fleet of over 3000 electric delivery vans and other zeroemission vehicles Additionally over half a million packages were delivered to our customers doorsteps in North America with EVs More than 100 Amazon delivery stations across North America and Europe are equipped for EV usage and all new delivery stations are designed to meet the needs of our current and future electric delivery fleets,24
Additionally we are using micromobility technologies to transform the way packages are delivered particularly in urban settings In 2021 more than 5 million shipments across 17 European cities and 30 million packages in Manhattan New York were delivered to our customers doorsteps using cargo bikes and walkers Our global bicycle fleet includes traditional bicycles and electric bikes connected to cargo trailers that can carry up to 45 packages at a time More than 400 cargo bikes are used to make deliveries for Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh to customers in Manhattan and Brooklyn in New York City,15
We announced in November 2021 that in the city of Paris twothirds of our shipments are delivered using zeroemission transportation This was achieved through a combination of EVs cargo bikes and carts for deliveries on foot through our Delivery Service Partnersall of which contribute to decarbonizing the lastmile delivery process,15
Delivering for our global customers requires Amazon to rely on a variety of transportation solutions for long and short distances Decarbonizing our transportation network is a key part of meeting The Climate Pledge by 2040 and making 50 of Amazon shipments netzero carbon by 2030 which is why we are actively transforming our fleet network and operations,13
Packages delivered across Europe with zeroemission vehicles,23
Shipments delivered in Europe using micromobility solutions,15
Packages delivered in Manhattan New York using cargo bikes and walkers,19
One of the ways we are decarbonizing our transportation network is by deploying technical solutions including zero emission vehicles and lowcarbon fuels We are preparing our systems and facilities to accommodate the large scale adoption of zeroemission vehicles in the coming years which will require new refueling infrastructure and operating patterns,21
Achieving our netzero carbon goal will also demand long term solutions that have not yet been invented along with an abundant supply of clean energy sources to power those technologies Knowing this we are investing in breakthrough innovations through The Climate Pledge Fund and forging industry partnerships to accelerate change,13
Deploying Solutions Across Our Network,15
LastMile Delivery We use a range of delivery methods to reduce emissions on lastmile routes to our customers doorsteps These include electric delivery vehicles and micromobility technologies that can be used for shorter journeys,24

MiddleMile and Long Distance Transportation When it comes to transporting goods over longer distances we rely on transportation across roads rail air and water each of which offers few existing lowcarbon solutions that can be immediately deployed at scale We are promoting the use of lowcarbon solutions in the near term while also investing in emerging technologies and collaborating with others to accelerate crosssector innovation in middlemile and longdistance transportation for the future,24
In North America and Europe we increased our total rail load volume and expanded our Amazon and leased rail assets in 2021 We started deploying battery EV trucks across our heavy commercial trucking fleets and began switching to vehicles that use alternative fuel sources like compressed natural gas CNG trucks As of 2021 we had ordered more than 3000 CNG vehicles and we are procuring millions of gallons of renewable natural gas created from waste stocks to power them significantly reducing carbon emissions and particulate matter pollutants,25
We are investing in alternative fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel which reduces carbon emissions in flight up to 20 over standard aviation fuel Amazon secured more than 5 million gallons of lowcarbon aviation fuel in 2020 and agreed to purchase up to 65 million gallons in 2021 and 2022 We also joined the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance members to drive investment and send market signals in support of sustainable aviation fuel,24
in 2021 and became one of the groups founding,12
We also purchased sustainable fuel made from waste cooking oil to reduce shipping emissions in ocean shipping This purchase was estimated to have reduced emissions by approximately 20000 metric tons of CO2e in 2021 which will be continued in 2022 We continue to advance public policies at the national and multinational levels that will support the decarbonization of the maritime shipping sector,21
Partnering to Support Solutions of the Future,15
We know that moving to moresustainable transportation will require innovative solutions and sustainable fuels that do not yet exist Through The Climate Pledge Fund we are helping inventors and entrepreneurs move faster with an investment portfolio that includes breakthrough transportation technologies such as those being developed by Rivian BETA Technologies Resilient Power Amogy Infinium and ZeroAvia,3
In 2021 we helped launch Emission Vessels coZEV with the Aspen Institute Through coZEV Amazon is supporting initiatives to increase the availability of zeroemission technologies and fuels while gaining support from shipping lines cargo owners ports and other organizations that can enable energy transition We also became a founding private sector member of the First Movers Coalition to lead decarbonization of the maritime shipping industry The coalition brings global companies together to harness their purchasing power and supply chains to create early markets for innovative clean energy technologies that are key for tackling the climate crisis With this launch we announced our commitment to use ships with zeroemission fuels for at least 10 of the volume of our goods shipped internationally by 2030 and 100 by 2040,24
Additionally we are driving policies that support the adoption of green technology around the world In May 2021 we supported a policy proposal to the Japanese government for the adoption of zeroemission vehicles in the delivery industry by the Japan Climate Leaders Partnership The government set a new target of 100 electric or fuel cell vehicles in new delivery vehicle sales by 2040 It also introduced intensive measures to adopt EVs over the next decade through the Green Growth Strategy,12
By joining the First Movers Coalition we are sending a clear signal that companies like Amazon are seeking longterm lowcarbon fuel solutions to help us achieve netzero carbon by 2040 We welcome the Biden administration and the World Economic Forums decision to launch the First Movers Coalition which will help further accelerate our efforts to decarbonize our operations through real business change and innovation,3
Andy Jassy President and CEO Amazon,18
Amazon works with thousands of external transportation providers from individual truck owners to multinational logistics service companies As part of our work to decarbonize our transportation network we want to make clean technologies available and accessible to all of them In 2021 we held our first virtual transportation sustainability summit FASTforward focused on Future Advanced Sustainable Transportation The summit brought together industry leaders fleet operators and manufacturers researchers and policy experts from Europe to share experiences and inspire action,15
Beyond Amazons commitment to decarbonize our operations we are working to send less material to landfills and more back into the circular economy loop The majority of the waste we produce comes through our customer fulfillment operations from materials that become obsolete in our supply chain or from surplus inventory including items that are overstocked returned cosmetically damaged or near expiration,19
The best way to reduce waste is to avoid creating it in the first place through wasteprevention programs and optimized inventory management Reuse is the next best option and is achieved by repairing repurposing and donating usable itemsall actions weve developed programs to support We then rely on recycling and composting to enable the recovery of raw materials and as a last resort we seek to recover energy from any waste material that must be sent to landfill,19

Avoiding Waste Through Product Donations,19
At our global fulfillment centers we use software to identify and sort eligible items that are fit for donation We partner with local community organizations to collect these items from Amazon facilities and distribute them to people in need By donating surplus inventory to charitable organizations we keep usable products out of the waste stream and help strengthen our local communities,15
Many of our product donations are generated through our Fulfillment by Amazon FBA donations program which automates the process for Amazon selling partners to donate their overstocked or returned items The service requires no additional action from selling partners allowing Amazon to easily scale product donations through our existing logistics,15
We distribute the majority of our product donations through Good360 a nonprofit that works with a network of 100000 charity partners in the US Through our partnership with Good360 Amazon product donations are distributed to low income households foster families individuals with special needs or disabilities seniors veterans immigrants and more In Europe we partner directly with more than 100 charities and local organizations to distribute product donations,15
Since 2019 Amazon has contributed more than 100 million products to our global charity partners in North America Europe Australia and Japan We are continuing to expand our product donations program globally by adding new locations in the Middle East North Africa and South America,15
As an online food retailer and an operator of physical grocery stores Amazon is committed to reducing our food waste,19
CityServe based in California is one example of a Good360 Community Redistribution Partner it works with a network of local churches to deliver necessities to thousands of individuals and families,2
In 2021 our donations enabled CityServe to provide personal care supplies to more than 20000 people CityServe staff and volunteers assembled blessing bags full of items donated by Amazon including toothpaste toothbrushes hand towels and disposable masks The bags were distributed to individuals and families without housing,2
by 50 across our US and Europe operations by 2030 We became a member of the Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions through the US Environmental Protection Agency in 2020 and extended our commitment to reducing food waste to our Europe operations in 2021 To achieve this we are optimizing our food inventory management systems to minimize waste from the outset and prioritizing ways to avoid landfills,19
Wherever possible we donate surplus food to individuals and families who need it most through community redistribution programs In 2021 we donated 85 million pounds of foodequivalent to more than 70 million mealsthrough Feeding America in the US Feeding America is a network of food banks pantries soup kitchens shelters and other communitybased agencies that helps Amazon maximize the impact of our food donations In Europe we donated more than 4000 tons of foodequivalent to 10 million mealsin,2
2021 All of our UK grocery stores have a donation partner in place that helps deliver surplus food to charities around London Similarly all of our US grocery stores have a donation partner,6
For food that cant be donated we turn to processes that avoid landfills such as composting and anaerobic digestion In 2021 we diverted 27000 tons of food through composting and anaerobic digestion across our worldwide operations All Amazon Fresh stores operating in the US have composting programs for food that cannot be donated and we are expanding our onsite composting capabilities across our facilities,6
At our Whole Foods Market stores we have active composting programs at nearly 470 locations and collectively diverted more than 155000 tons of food waste by the end of 2021 Another 2775 tons of food waste were sent,19
to anaerobic digestion facilities through an organic waste recycling system called Grind2Energy The Grind2Energy system has helped to divert 12500 tons of food waste at Whole Foods Market stores since 2014 As a result we have prevented nearly 9000 metric tons of CO2e from entering the atmosphere and produced enough clean renewable energy to power over 2500 US homes for a month,19
Recycling Solutions Across Our Operations,15
Corrugated board is the most common material that flows through our fulfillment center operations and we work with thirdparty recycling haulers to remove excess corrugate from our facilities for offsite recycling Many of these haulers also supply Amazon with the packaging materials that we use for customer shipments converting waste material recovered from Amazon operations into new recycled packaging,19
Not all the materials we use can be easily recycled with current systems so we look for innovative solutions to recycle these challenging materials One example is plastic film which is not commonly accepted through municipal recycling programs We have onsite plastic film recycling systems at many Amazon operations facilities across North America and Europe enabling us to convert plastic film into bags made of 100 recycled material,15
We continue to explore alternative solutions for other materials that are challenging to recycle In 2021 we completed a pilot to recycle and repair damaged bags used to sort and stow items in our fulfillment operations into reusable materials Additionally we work with our shipping label suppliers in several European locations to recycle the silicone backing paper from shipping labels to make new ones,15
Packaging plays a critical role in the customer delivery experience and Amazon is committed to delivering products safely and sustainably Since 2015 we have invested in materials processes and technologies that have reduced pershipment packaging weight by 38 and eliminated over 15 million tons of packaging,15
Amazon customers want rightsized recyclable packaging that minimizes waste and ensures damagefree delivery We work to reinvent and simplify our sustainable packaging options using a sciencebased approach that combines lab testing machine learning materials science and manufacturing partnerships to scale sustainable change across the packaging supply chain,15
FrustrationFree Packaging FFP is Amazons flagship program designed to reinvent the packaging experience FFP products offer moresustainable packaging that is easy to open fully recyclable and capable of shipping without additional packaging protection In 2021 we began offering incentives to vendors that convert their packaging to FFP to encourage more vendors to adopt these bestin class standards We also offer additional incentives when those changes include reductions in total cubic volume This generates less packaging waste for customers and enables more packages per delivery vehicle By the end of 2021 more than 2 million products qualified under our FFP programs,15
Some products are more difficult to ship than others Stemware for example is fragile and frequently arrives with multiple layers of padding to prevent damage This additional material can make for a frustrating customer experience and doesnt always protect the product,15
To demonstrate that ecommerce packaging can be both minimal and effective we facilitated a complete redesign of stemware packaging for Lenox a well known brand that has specialized in tableware and glassware for over 130 years,15
This novel packaging design includes changing product orientation to optimize for space It also includes a protective corrugate insert replacing the need for bubble wrap further reducing plastic waste and improving the customer experience The result is a fully recyclable package that uses 83 less material weight and 78 less volume without compromising protection of the item inside,15
Cold Groceries Delivered More Sustainably,15
In 2021 US grocery teams launched new curbside recyclable packaging to replace nonrecyclable insulation that protects chilled items in grocery deliveries This has eliminated the annual need for 1500 tons of natural cotton fiber and 7500 tons of nonrecyclable mixed plastic that was previously required to safely deliver chilled or frozen groceries from Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market,15
It is particularly challenging to design new solutions that maintain adequate insulation properties to keep products chilled Our innovative packaging uses layers of tissue to provide both durability and insulation without sacrificing recyclability,15
Customers were with us for every step of this journey,15
Learn more about how we tested this packaging in several US cities and incorporated improvements into the design based on customer feedback,15
Optimizing Materials Where Packaging Is Necessary,15
When additional Amazon packaging is required to ship a product we strive to optimize that packaging for increased recyclability along with reduced waste and carbon We are transitioning to materials that are compatible with local paper and plastic recycling streams where we operate We also support initiatives to expand the availability of curbside recycling infrastructure to the public through investments in The Recycling Partnership and the Closed Loop Infrastructure Fund,15
In the US we expanded the use of our recyclable paper padded mailer replacing nearly 70 of our mixed material bubble mailers in 2021 We also improved the composition of our singleuse plastic packaging to use less material and incorporate more recycled content In 2021 we increased the recycled content of our plastic film bags from 25 to 50 and that of our plastic padded bags from 15 to over 40 Through these collective efforts we avoided over 30000 tons of plastic across North America in 2021,15
In Europe we switched from singleuse plastic delivery bags to recyclable paper delivery bags and cardboard envelopes for orders shipped from fulfillment centers in 2021 We also removed a wide range of singleuse plastic products from our European stores In Australia we replaced all singleuse air pillows with 100 recyclable paper material to protect goods during shipping Amazon also became a founding member of the India Plastics Pact after removing singleuse thin film plastics from Amazon packaging throughout India fulfillment centers in 2020,15
Using Technology to Optimize Packaging Type and Fit,15
We use a range of boxes and mailers across our fulfillment network and for every shipment that requires packaging we use sciencebased systems to determine optimal packaging sizes and types This starts with using machine learning to identify products that can be delivered safely with less material Machine learning algorithms help us determine,15
when smaller products are suitable for flexible packaging such as padded mailers and bags which are up to 75 lighter than similarsized boxes Over the past five years these algorithms have allowed us to reduce the use of corrugated boxes by over 35,15
In 2021 we deployed datascience algorithms to optimize the number and size of boxes used for 12 geographies around the world These algorithmswhich help our fulfillment centers maintain the right mix of box sizes now cover 65 of global box shipments with plans to scale to 97 in 2022,6
We also introduced advanced fitting algorithms designed to reduce packaging specifically for shipments with multiple items These new algorithms calculate the possible arrangements of products for best fit in a three dimensional virtual package Since launch this technology has downgraded the size or type of packaging for 7 of total shipments and we plan to deploy it globally in 2022,15

Designing Our Devices and Services for Sustainability,15
Amazon devices and services are a part of everyday life for millions of customers around the world They inform entertain and connect our customers and we are working hard to make our devices more sustainable That includes helping customers reduce their impact on the environment through our products and services,15
We design our devices to be more sustainable by measuring and reducing carbon emissions at all stages of the product lifecycle from how the devices are made to how they are used and ultimately disposed of We extend our impact by delivering products and experiences to help customers manage their own environmental impact,15
We incorporate recycled materials into many new Amazon devices In 2021 we launched several Echo Fire TV Fire Tablet Kindle and Smart Home devices and accessories that include up to 60 recycled molded plastic up to 100 recycled fabrics up to 100 recycled aluminum and up to 70 recycled magnesium depending on the product We also incorporated 50 recycled plastic into certain power adapters that ship with our devices,15
To advance the move to safer chemistry we joined ChemFORWARD as a codesign partner Through this partnership we are collaborating with industry peers to proactively identify harmful chemicals and safer alternatives ahead of regulations,14
In 2020 we committed to making Amazon device packaging 100 recyclable by 2023 Additionally we are working to source 100 of the wood fiber in our packaging from responsibly managed forests or recycled sources We have made significant progress toward our goals eliminating more than 29 million plastic bags from our device packaging between September 2020 and September 2021 For new Echo Fire TV Stick Fire Tablet and Kindle Paperwhite devices launched in 2021 9498 of the packaging is made of wood fiberbased materials from responsibly managed forests or recycled sources depending on the product,15
In 2020 Amazon became the first consumer electronics company to commit to addressing the electricity used by our devices through renewable energy development starting with our Echo devices We are also making investments in additional wind and solar farm capacity that by 2025 will be equal to the energy use of Fire TV and Ring devices worldwide Combined we expect these projects will produce over 5 million megawatthours of clean energy per year thats enough to power more than 400000 homes,24
To accompany our investments in renewable energy we also continue to make our devices more energy efficient We have been rolling out Low Power Mode to new devices as well as to older devices already in customers homes By the end of 2021 over 50 of all Echo and Fire TV devices in customers homes had Low Power Mode We also launched a number of new Fire Tablet Fire TV and Amazon Smart Home devices in 2021 that were designed for energy efficiency and earned the ENERGY STAR certification,24
We design our devices with bestinclass reliability models so that they are more resilient last longer and dont need to be replaced as often We also release overtheair software updates for our customers devices with feature and security updates,3
We work with our suppliers to encourage sustainability as a top priority In 2021 we launched our Zero Waste to Landfill program for suppliers Ten of our supplier sites responsible for the final assembly of some of our most popular Echo Kindle and Fire TV devices achieved ULs Zero Waste to Landfill Silver or Platinum certificationa significant step toward achieving our zerowaste ambitions This certification indicates that waste has been handled in environmentally responsible ways diverting more than 90 of a facilitys waste from landfill through methods other than waste to energy,19
We partner with trusted and transparent external certifications to validate the sustainability of our products and clearly communicate this to customers with the Climate Pledge Friendly label In 2020 and 2021 our Echo Fire TV Fire Tablet Kindle Paperwhite and Smart Home devices and accessories launched with the Climate Pledge Friendly label Many of these products carry the Carbon Trusts Reducing CO2 certification demonstrating a reduction in the carbon emissions of a product year over year The Amazon Smart Thermostat is the first Amazon device to be ECOLOGO Silver certifieda certification that demonstrates products meet standards that can reduce the environmental impact of one or more stages of the product lifecycle,15
We are making it easier for customers to understand their home energy use with the Alexa energy dashboard available in the US The dashboard works with compatible smart lights plugs switches water heaters thermostats televisions and Echo devices allowing customers to easily estimate the energy used by these devices Customers can also enable Alexa to help them conserve energy with Hunches For example if Alexa has a Hunch that a customer is away and forgot to turn off a light Alexa can automatically turn it off helping customers save energy and reduce carbon emissions,24
focused on how we are integrating carbon,3
To drive change beyond our business we look for ways to share learnings and innovations that have shaped the way we design our products This allows others to leverage our expertise and make moresustainable products for their own customers In early 2022 we published a paper called Decarbonizing and Neutralizing the Use Phase of Connected Devices reduction strategies across the use phase of our devices These strategies account for an estimated 1015 of the overall carbon footprint of rechargeable batteryoperated devices and an estimated 6080 of the footprint of pluggedin devices At Amazon we recognize that we cannot solve this challenge alone and we are eager to invite other consumer electronics companies and connected device manufacturers to join the mission of driving to a netzero carbon use phase,15
delivered six projects constructed with recycled steel in 2021 and will expand this to all future US and European data centers moving forward,24
Concrete also contributes a large share of embodied carbon in data center construction and AWS has multiple initiatives to reduce the carbon impact of the concrete required For example our design standards now require concrete with a 20 reduction in embodied carbon versus standard concrete for new US data centers and we are expanding this requirement globally,24
AWS is the worlds most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud offering with millions of global users depending on it every day To build a sustainable business for our customers and for the world we all share we are designing data centers that provide the efficient resilient service our customers expect while minimizing our environmental footprintand theirs,3
We focus on efficiency across all aspects of our infrastructure from the design of our data centers and hardware to modeling the performance of our operations for continuous enhanced efficiency We are on a path to power our operations with 100 renewable energy by 2025 These renewable energy investments help power our data centers as part of our commitment to reach netzero carbon across our operations by 2040,24
For AWS operating sustainably also means reducing the amount of water we use to cool our data centers Our holistic approach minimizes both energy and water consumption in our operations and guides the development of our water use strategy for each AWS Region where we operate,20
In addition we work to reduce the carbon emitted during the extraction manufacturing and transportation of materials to data center construction sites Reducing this embodied carbon offers a significant opportunity to cut our overall emissions from data centers,25
AWS also continually innovates on cooling efficiency For example we worked with our vendors to optimize the longevity and airflow performance of the cooling medium used in our data center cooling systems The new medium provides twice the service life and allows air to pass through more easily than previous iterations saving fan energy This has significant impacts on building energy performance reducing the energy use of cooling equipment by 20,24
Predicting and Tracking Performance We use advanced modeling methods such as computational fluid dynamics tools to optimize our data center design This allows us to fully understand how the data center will perform before it is ever built enabling us to optimize for higher reliability and energy efficiency in our systems Once our data centers are operational realtime physics based models allow us to further improve and optimize our designs We build these custom models using AWS services and weather datasets from the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative to predict system performance for our sites and track their performance against how they should be operating,24
We are using innovation to improve power efficiency in multiple ways including our investment in AWSdesigned chips and the AWS Nitro System For instance AWS designed Graviton3 is our most powerefficient general purpose processor Graviton3based Elastic Compute Cloud EC2 instances use up to 60 less energy for the same performance than nonGraviton EC2 instances With the worlds increasing need for computing and as machine learning has become mainstream continually innovating at the chip level will be critical to sustainably powering the workloads of the future,24
In addition to emissions from our energy usage AWS addresses a wide range of indirect emissionsincluding those associated with the construction of our data centers Steel is one of the largest contributors of embodied carbon in the structure of AWS data centers and we are lowering these emissions by working with mills using electric arc furnace production processes Unlike conventional steel produced from primary materials coal and gas our suppliers are using up to 100 recycled content and are powered by electricity only reducing embodied carbon up to 70 We,21
AWS is 36 times more energy efficient than the median of US enterprise data centers surveyed,24
AWS is up to five times more energy efficient than the average data center surveyed in Europe,24
Moving to AWS Can Help Significantly Lower Carbon,12
AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool,13
part of SP Global Market Intelligence have shown that AWS,18
Studies by 451 Research infrastructure is more efficient than onpremises data centers AWS is 36 times more energy efficient than the median of US enterprise data centers surveyed and up to five times more energy efficient than the average in Europe A similar study that surveyed organizations in Japan South Korea Singapore Australia and India found that on average moving to the cloud was up to five times more energy efficient than using their onpremises data centers,24
After analyzing several regions 451 Research also found that AWS can lower customers workload carbon footprints by nearly 80 compared to surveyed enterprise data centers and up to 96 once AWS is powered with 100 renewable energya target we are on path to meet by 2025,24
As AWS continues to invest in sustainability across our infrastructure many of our customers have asked us to help measure the carbon footprint of their AWS workloadsboth to understand how moving to AWS reduces their carbon footprint and to report their overall footprint,25
Our new customer carbon footprint tool uses simple visualizations to show customers their historical carbon emissions evaluate related trends as their use of AWS evolves estimate emissions avoided by using AWS instead of an onpremises data center and review forecasted emissions based on their current usage,25
The forecast shows how customers footprints will change as Amazon stays on path to powering our operations with 100 renewable energy by 2025 five years earlier than the original target of 2030 and drives toward netzero carbon by 2040,24
In addition historical carbon emissions data is available based on a customers AWS use from January 2020 onward This data includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions Scope 1 emissions come directly from a companys operations while Scope 2 emissions come from the generation of purchased energy such as the electricity used to power Amazon facilities,21
The customer carbon footprint tool uses carbon data that meets the widely adopted international standard of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol which supplies the worlds most widely used greenhouse gas accounting standards When signed into the AWS Billing console customers can view their carbon emissions data by geographical location and by AWS service such as EC2 and Amazon Simple Storage Service Amazon S3 They can also measure changes in their carbon footprint over time as they deploy new resources in the cloud,25
Community Water Programs Water is a key resource we share with those who live where we operate so we look for opportunities to return water to these communities For example we partnered with the City of Umatilla and the West Extension Irrigation District to deliver water to farmers in Oregon Instead of going to a wastewater treatment plant our clean cooling water goes into a canal that delivers the water to farmers for use in irrigation With this project we reuse up to 96 of the wastewater we discharge from our data centers in this region,20
In 2021 we funded watershed restoration efforts by The Nature Conservancy in Cape Town South Africa and,23
So Paulo Brazil These completed projects have restored 365 hectares of land and increased water supply availability by 45 million gallons per year,20
Through partnerships with Waterorg and WaterAid in India and Indonesia we initially intended to provide clean water to 165000 people By the time these partnerships concluded in early 2022 we surpassed our goal and provided clean water and sanitation to over 250000 community members In 2022 we began supporting a new set of projects which include wetland creation in the Thames River Basin in England and water quality projects in the Chesapeake Bay watershed in the US,20
Water Stewardship in Data Centers,20
Amazon knows water is a precious resource Our holistic approach minimizes both energy and water consumption in our data center operations and guides our water use strategy for each AWS Region This starts with evaluating climate patterns local water management and availability and opportunities to avoid using potable water sources whenever possible We are committed to conserving and reusing water both in our onsite operations and by working with private and public entities to support water availability in communities where we operate data centers,20
Evaporative Cooling Our preferred cooling strategy for data centers uses evaporative technologies We analyze the weather in each region and monitor our cooling system which is designed to maximize environmental cooling and minimize water use During the hottest months of the year we have optimized systems to minimize water usage Outside air is cooled through an evaporative process and pushed into the server rooms to keep hardware at stable operating temperatures With this design even our largest data centers at full capacity would use on average about the same water in a year as only 25 US households During cooler months where possible outside air is supplied directly to the data center without needing to be cooled,24
We are constantly innovating the design of our cooling systems to further reduce water usage We are installing sensors that provide realtime wateruse data to operators and sustainability teams By analyzing this data we can identify opportunities to reduce water usage and rapidly make operational changes,20
Recycled Water We evaluate the opportunity to reduce our consumption of potable water and are actively expanding our use of nonpotable and recycled water for cooling purposes In certain regions we work directly with utilities and regulators to obtain approval for the use of recycled water in direct evaporative cooling technology We are continuing to work with water utilities in various regions to expand this recycled water infrastructure Through these actions we are actively contributing to sustainable water solutions by reducing our impact on the local potable water supply for the communities where we operate,20
OnSite Water Treatment We use onsite modular watertreatment systems in multiple regions which allow us to remove scaleforming minerals and reuse water for more cycles Increasing our cycles of concentration contributes to reducing the water intake needed to cool our data centers,20
The Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative ASDI helps researchers scientists and innovators around the world advance their work on sustainabilityrelated research The program provides publicly available free access to important scientific data that can otherwise be hard for researchers to access or analyze,12
ASDI works with scientific organizations around the world to identify important datasets which are then hosted for free by the AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program The program currently hosts petabytes of data including weather observations ocean temperatures climate projection data and satellite imagery,13
Our approach allows sustainability experts to analyze massive amounts of data in minutes regardless of where they are in the world or how much local storage space or computing capacity they can access,24
Innovating for Sustainability in the Cloud,3
From university researchers to local governments and federal agencies to private startups organizations leverage ASDI to help address major sustainability challenges ASDI encourages this by providing cloud grants to those interested in exploring the use of AWS technology Here are some examples of how ASDI is helping drive sustainability innovations,12
Solcast Solcast is an Australian company that builds forecasts for solar industry customers using cloud cover solar radiation and photovoltaic PV power data The forecasts help solar producers predict the amount of solar irradiance and the amount of solar PV energy that their farms may receive Solcasts forecasts rely on large datasets from a global fleet of weather satellites including Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites GOES data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA which Solcast accesses through ASDI,24
The data helps solar customers orchestrate renewable energy generation across electrical grids visualize the impact of thousands of PV systems and optimize utilityscale batteries and solar farms In addition the data helps identify the best locations for solar farms enabling governments around the world to plan their transition toward a 100 renewable energy future Learn more on the AWS blog,24
Digital Earth Africa Digital Earth Africa is a nonprofit working with African nations to provide local leaders with information to plan for impacts related to climate change like flooding droughts and erosion Through a collaboration with ASDI Digital Earth Africa is using satellite imagery hosted on AWS to create a platform that helps monitor environmental conditions in the African continent,13
In Zanzibar Tanzania government officials and the State University of Zanzibar are using the Digital Earth Africa platform to monitor how coastal erosion rising sea levels and deforestation are contributing to the degradation of mangrove trees on the island The data hosted on AWS which local officials previously had no way to access has helped leaders understand the need to restore their mangroves and led to an effort to plant 1000 mangrove seeds per week,23
nauticAi nauticAi is a maritime startup company from Finland that offers ocean freight shipping companies a realtime cloud platform to help them operate their fleets more efficiently The technology analyzes a variety of data including weather forecasts engine performance humidity and motion which operators can use to improve ships performance and help vessels avoid damaging storms,13
Weather data in particular can help shippers optimize their routes Traditionally these and other climaterelated datasets have resided around the world in large files and complex systems making them hard to access without the aid of specialized computers To solve this nauticAi is leveraging weather forecast data through ASDI from NOAA and the Finnish Meteorological Institute nauticAis technology also uses machine learning and artificial intelligence tools on AWS to further improve maritime operations,13
Qhub The Earth Science Information Partners Lab a scientific nonprofit is working with ASDI to extend cloud credits to support the deployment of Qhub a development space on the AWS Cloud that gives more than 90 scientists across four US government agencies an area to share and analyze data,1
This new space enables the US federal government and the scientists to collaborate in ways that were previously difficult due to the lack of a shared computing infrastructure The effort has helped accelerate research on everything from flooding to illegal mining while helping the scientists learn the benefits of collaborative data and computing,1

We are committed to embedding human rights considerations into decisionmaking across our company and into our policy and governance framework Amazons Board of Directors is responsible for the control and direction of Amazon and regularly reviews reports on various aspects,10
of our business including related risks and the strategies for addressing them While the entire Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight the Board has delegated responsibility for certain risks to its committees,18
Among other duties and responsibilities the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees Amazons environmental social and corporate governance policies and initiatives This includes policies and initiatives related to corporate social responsibility such as human rights and ethical business practices and related risks most relevant to Amazons operations and engagement with customers suppliers and communities Among other duties and responsibilities the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee oversees Amazons strategies and policies related to human capital management including diversity and inclusion workplace environment and safety and corporate culture The Committees regularly meet with management and review these matters,10

Mechanisms to Assess Prioritize and Address Risk,18
We are committed to assessing prioritizing and addressing adverse human rights impacts connected to our business and we are continually working to improve our approach At Amazon businesses deploy a variety of mechanisms to do this,10
In our supply chain we assess and respond to risk by leveraging internal and external data and guidance from external stakeholders including industry experts civil society groups and NGOs We engage directly with suppliers and their workers and conduct independent audits to verify compliance with our Supply Chain Standards We also work with suppliers on appropriate remediation measures and offer partnerships and programs to help them address risks and invest in worker wellbeing,17
We recognize that audits alone are insufficient to drive long term change across industries We like many companies in similar industries are exploring new ways to encourage improvement in worker protections This includes supporting suppliers efforts to improve their grievance mechanisms supplier capacitybuilding programs worker trainings and collaborations with other brands and civil society We currently focus our supply chain efforts on key commitment areas Safe Workplaces Freely Chosen Employment Gender Equity Fair Wages Environmental Protection and Grievance Mechanisms,11

Identifying Salient Human Rights Risks The UNGPs guide companies to prioritize the most severe risks to people connected to their operations and business relationships and are the foundation of our human rights due diligence approach Teams use a variety of tools saliency assessments human rights impact assessments HRIAs and other human rightsbased processes grounded in the UNGPsto assess prioritize and address the most severe risks to people,10
In 2020 Amazon worked with sustainability and human rights consulting firm Article One Advisors to conduct our first enterprisewide saliency assessment focused on identifying salient human rights risks across our business We consulted a diverse group of external human rights,10
experts incorporated their feedback into the results and benchmarked the results against internationally recognized human rights standards The assessment identified a set of priority human rights values three foundational commitments and key salient human rights risks for Amazon,10
The saliency assessment was a key milestone in the development of our human rights due diligence strategy Building on this work in 2021 we made progress on our salient human rights risks and furthered our efforts to implement human rights due diligence mechanisms What follows are some examples of how we assessed and addressed our salient risks prioritizing our three foundational commitments,10

Human Rights Impact Assessments Our teams use HRIAs as a due diligence tool to identify and address adverse impacts business activities might have on individuals such as workers local community members or consumers HRIAs surface detailed information about our human rights risks and root causes as well as stakeholder perspectives so that we can address those risks with targeted action For each HRIA we partner with an independent human rights consulting firm to conduct the assessment facilitate stakeholder engagement and deliver recommendations for improved business practices to address the relevant human rights risks,10
Below we provide an update on our first HRIA summarized in our 2020 Sustainability Report,3
linked to potential risks We have policies and mechanisms in place to help address these potential risks including our Supply Chain Standards regular supplier assessments and grievance mechanisms,17
In 2021 we began implementing recommendations from the HRIA such as increasing our support for industry collaboration on responsible mineral sourcing and building the capacity of our supply chain partners to effectively manage human rights risks We also began developing a multiyear Amazonbranded digital devices strategy to address risks seeking perspectives from organizations with expertise in human rights inclusive economy circularity and responsible innovation to meet the expectations of our customers and impacted communities,10
Update on Our Devices Supply Chain HRIA In 2020 we conducted Amazons first HRIA on the raw and recovered materials supply chain for Amazonbranded digital devices Using the UNGPs as a framework to guide the assessment the HRIA results indicated we are directly linked to potential risks for Tier 12 manufacturing and reverse logistics suppliers For minerals metals plastics and synthetics suppliers results indicated we are indirectly,17
In 2021 several final assembly and manufacturing suppliers of Amazonbranded digital devices participated in the RBA Factory Lead Certification Program The program trains factory management on effective worker communication and maintaining safe working conditions allowing suppliers to proactively prevent or mitigate potential issues before they arise,9
Stakeholder Engagement Engagement with external stakeholders is key to our human rights due diligence approach This collaboration is essential to identifying positive outcomes for people connected to our business and is part of our responsibility to respect human rights in line with the UNGPs We rely on experts and affected rightsholders to inform our approach and validate that our efforts have the intended impact Through regular stakeholder engagement and strategic partnerships we incorporate invaluable expert input into our work helping us achieve greater impact on people connected to our business around the world,10

We developed a set of Worker Voice Criteria to outline key expectations and drive best practices for our suppliers and service providers that are implementing and maintaining worker voice mechanisms These criteria draw from the UNGPs and the Worker Engagement Supported by Technology WEST Principles with internationally recognized human rights,10
Worker Inclusive Worker trust is paramount workers should have input into the mechanisms design and performance particularly how worker voice mechanisms will address and resolve issues,11
Privacy Ensured Mechanisms must never cause harm to workers mechanisms must have adequate safeguards in place providing workers with notice of how data will be protected,1
Equitable and Accessible Mechanisms should accommodate diversity and ensure that workers have reasonable access to the information advice and expertise necessary to engage with the mechanism Workers who face particular barriers due to language literacy or disability should have adequate assistance,8
Transparent and Predictable Mechanisms should provide users with clear procedures to set expectations on time frames how outcomes will be monitored and how stakeholders will be informed about the mechanisms effectiveness,12
Source of Continuous Learning New mechanisms should be adequately resourced developed to complement existing mechanisms and used to understand areas of risk and integrate feedback into the design and implementation of programs,18
In 2021 we expanded our efforts to help suppliers build and employ worker voice tools and improve their capacity to respond to worker grievances in Cambodia China India Pakistan Bangladesh and Vietnam,11
Grievance Mechanisms and Effective Access to Remedy,12
As part of our first enterprisewide human rights saliency assessment we made a foundational commitment that those in our value chain have the opportunity for concerns to be heard and issues resolved Focusing on listening to the people connected to our business and understanding their experiences to address risks and remedy issues is a critical element of our human rights approach and a core obligation under the UNGPs,10
In our operations consistent honest and open communication with our employees allows us to continually improve our workplace experience empowering individuals to voice concerns and have them directly addressed by leadership Our goal is to hear from and listen to everyone Dedicated teams across the company focus on establishing open communication with our employees providing them with meaningful grievance mechanisms and avenues for dialogue with leadership Aligning with the UNGP framework Amazons policies and practices are designed to promote respect for the rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining and to comply with the legal requirements of the countries where we operate As stated in our Leadership Principles we Strive to be Earths Best Employer offering a safer more productive higher performing more diverse and more just work environment We have many policies practices and mechanisms in place to provide open lines of communication between leadership and employees and act regularly to address employee concerns and make improvements We recognize that Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility We must begin each day with a determination to make better do better and be better for our customers our employees our partners and the world at large,11

Amazon strives to be a great place to work whether our employees are building lifelong careers with us or developing skills to help them on their professional journeys This begins with offering competitive starting wages in locations around the world and continues with benefits support and opportunities to help employees reach their full potential,8
Sylvias Caf a Caribbeanstyle restaurant run by wifeandhusband team Sylvia Burke and Franois Theodore is located near a 24 million square foot Amazon fulfillment center in Opalocka Florida Throughout the pandemic the presence of Amazon employees looking for great food meant that the doors of Sylvias Caf didnt shut This was thanks in part to employees like Nelly Nelson whose higher wage means she can make better food choices,11

Focus on Cotton In 2021 we continued to strengthen our efforts to address human rights risks in global cotton supply chains Amazon joined Better Cottons Retailer and Brand Advisory Panel on Traceability to help steer Better Cottons initial vision and strategy toward achieving more traceable cotton in the coming years We also participated in the Responsible Sourcing Networks initiative YESS Yarn Ethically Sustainably Sourced YESS works to address forced labor in the cotton value chain by providing training to and managing the assessment of spinners and fabric mills to identify and address forced labor in cotton production,11

Our assessment data reflects findings for suppliers evaluated in 2019 2020 and 2021 and includes assessments of suppliers we no longer work with or with which we never began a business relationship Assessments may have found more than one issue listed We accept assessments completed by qualified independent audit firms based on our own assessment standards and those of industry associations including Sedex amfori and RBA certification standard Social Accountability International SA8000 and the Better Work program,17
Our assessment data helps us determine where to focus our efforts and resources and provides insight into industrywide challenges and systemic issues We are continually innovating to include new assessment types and data sources in our due diligence program We attribute the increase in transparency issues to the 2021 introduction of a remote,18
assessment tool which requires suppliers to provide records and documentation in real time We now provide suppliers with additional notice of this expectation to help preempt transparency issues In other cases the increased rate of findings in specific categories represents industrywide challenges that require industrylevel longterm solutions We have dedicated teams engaging directly with our suppliers on key safety wage and working hoursrelated findings We recognize that we cannot address many of these systemic issues alone and we are committed to engaging in industrylevel interventions in order to drive improvement in working conditions We are dedicated to working with our suppliers to understand root causes and build strong management systems to address and mitigate issues,9
