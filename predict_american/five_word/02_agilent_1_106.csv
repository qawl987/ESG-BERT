This team assembled last year to begin working on plans to engage suppliers regarding their carbon emissions The team has begun to 1 understand the total picture of Agilents ESG Program and the impact to suppliers 2 identify what is needed from our suppliers over the life of the commitment and 3 define the overall strategy and plans to achieve the desired results The team will officially kickoff programs in 2022 to work with suppliers on reducing Scope 3 emissions to acheive our shortterm reduction goals and netzero emissions by 2050,25
For the first time were reporting our progress on emissions and climate risk according to the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures TCFD recommendations This supplements our GRI and SASB reporting which we also included in this years report,13
Last year Agilent made an important commitment to achieve netzero greenhouse gas emissions GHG by 2050 Our net zero commitment includes how we work with customers and suppliers how we manage our internal operations and how we design our products In short it includes everything we do,25
We have committed to interim GHG emissions reduction targets From a baseline of 2019 we plan to reduce by 2030,25
Agilent Head of ESG Programs Neil Rees explains Agilents commitment to netzero emissions by 2050,25
This includes direct emissions from owned or controlled sources,21
This covers indirect emissions from the generation of electricity steam heating and cooling that Agilent purchases,24
This encompasses emissions throughout our value chain not controlled by Agilent including those from purchased goods and services to use of sold products to endoflife disposal,15
As part of our netzero goal we committed to setting sciencebased emissions reduction targets nearterm targets in line with the Science Based Targets initiative SBTi Criteria and Recommendations This will ensure our actions are externally validated and aligned with the scientific consensus to limit global warming to 15C above preindustrial levels which is required by the Paris Agreement,25
Scope 3 makes up the majority of our GHG emissions Meeting our reduction goals will require close collaboration across our supply chain In FY21 we began developing plans to engage and evaluate suppliers on their GHG emissions and will report on our progress in subsequent ESG reports,25
We manage our energy and emissions performance through our EHSMS On a quarterly basis we review our energy use and emissions and adjust if negative trends emerge keeping us on track to meet our annual targets and multiyear emissions and energy reduction goals,24
In 2021 we exceeded our 2025 shortterm emissions intensity target to reduce emissions per square foot by 25 and have already achieved a reduction in our emissions per square foot by 34 We will now focus on achieving our interim net zero target of a 50 reduction in emissions by 2030 Solar installations along with energy efficiency projects from 2021 are expected to lead to an annual reduction of 970 MT of CO2e emissions,21
Steps we have taken in FY2021 toward these goals include,10
Supplier Engagement on Scope 3 Emissions Reduction,17
We began developing a plan for engaging suppliers to reduce our Scope 3 emissions,25
We completed two new solar projects at manufacturing sites in China and Australia,15
We continued facility and process upgrades in manufacturing facilities related to lighting cold water pumps cooling towers heating and ventilation,24
We commissioned thirdparty sustainability audits at multiple sites to determine additional energy efficiency and renewable energy opportunities,24
Since our first large onsite project in 2008 we now have over 64 MW of installed capacity as of the end of FY21 Two new projects were completed at the end of FY21 and first quarter of FY22,24
In Shanghai China we installed a photovoltaic system on the roof of our manufacturing site to power the facilitys lighting and operations which we expect to save 245 MT of CO2e per year,24
In Singapore we installed a photovoltaic system to provide clean renewable energy for plant operations and lighting which we expect to save over 1900 MT of CO2e per year,24
Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG Emissions MT CO2e,25
Scope 3 Emissions MT CO2e,25
Total Scope 1 Scope 2,23
Note The 2021 increase in Scope 1 emissions is due to the addition of the Frederick Colorado and Lexington Massachusetts sites,25
Kintetsu World Express one of our thirdparty logistics vendors reported a significant reduction of estimated CO2e emissions in 2021 based on a change in the emissions calculations methodology for long and short haul flight factors,25
Business Travel Air Rail Rental Cars,24
Reduction Of GHG Emissions GRI from new energy projects,25
Scope 1 2 Intensity MT CO2eft2,25
Scope 1 2 MT CO2e,25
Annualized reductions are theoretical based on the predicted reduction in electricity usage as a direct result of GHG reduction projects in FY21 The 970 MT CO2e quoted is the is total expected annualized reduction in usage and not the actual total realized in FY21 as these projects were completed over the duration of FY21 and early in FY22,25
We set a goal to reduce energy intensity per square foot by 10 by 2024 2014 baseline and we exceeded that goal in 2021 reducing energy intensity by 12 To meet our energy reduction goals we continue evaluating new energy conservation projects and infrastructure improvements with significant longterm environmental and financial potential We have engaged a thirdparty vendor in a multiyear effort to conduct sustainability audits at sites with significant energy consumption We implemented or are in the process of evaluating dozens of recommended projects including solar PV upgrading and replacing HVAC systems waste heat recovery power factor correction and building automation systems for lighting HVAC and chillers,24
OFS also instituted a variety of energy savings projects at our manufacturing sites such as,24
At our manufacturing facility in Shanghai we invested in more efficient freezers with improved thermal stability and precise controls These upgrades resulted in reduced energy by 6 per 1 degree increase saving up to 484 kWhyear per freezer,24
Our gas chromatographymass spectrometry division was using hazardous chemical solvents to remove possible contaminants on parts we receive from our suppliers prior to assembly into the final instrument These solvents were highly flammable which necessitated costly fire suppression systems and consumed significant amounts of energy due to a high boiling point We custom designed and rolled out a new cleaner in 2021 that is non flammable biodegradable and effective for our application reducing energy use and improving safety,19
We consumed approximately 163000 MWh of energy in 2021 primarily from the use of electricity and solar PV and small amounts of gas or fuel oil for onsite heating and energy needs at our site in India,24
Total Direct Energy Consumption GJ,24
Estimated Reduction of Energy Consumption from New Measures GJ,24
Total Direct Indirect Energy Consumption GJ,24
Total Direct Indirect Energy Consumption kWh,24
Note The 2021 increase in energy consumption is due to the addition of the Frederick Colorado and Lexington Massachusetts sites,24
Note Estimates are typically based on efficiency improvements power consumption reduction etc,24
Each quarter we track our progress toward our municipal water use reduction goals These progress checks allow us to make any necessary adjustments in an effort to meet our annual expectations Our current target is a 20 reduction in water intensity over 10 years from a base year of 2014 In 2022 we reduced water consumption per operational square foot by 22 against a 2021 target of 14 which also exceeded our 2024 goal3,20
We will be conducting a water scarcity assessment in all of our operations in 2022 and then determine whether further mitigation is needed at any of our sites,20
Agilent sites discharge water related to domestic sanitation production operations and cooling systems which varies by site A small amount of water is discharged from onsite water treatment plants and is subject to local permit and environmental considerations Surface water is normally discharged to local surface water infrastructure and protected from any potential contamination on site The total water discharged to the sewer takes into account losses from evaporation and irrigation of site grounds,20
Normalized withdrawal m3site sq ft,24
3 In absolute terms this has amounted to a 12 reduction in water consumption in Agilents operations even though weve grown our operations and added sites to the operational portfolio,20
Waste is identified as one of Agilents significant environmental aspects In fiscal year 2021 we,19
Achieved 94 solid waste diversion,19
Diverted 10150 metric tons of total waste from disposal,19
thats a 56 increase over the 2020 fiscal year and just shy of our goal of 95,12
that includes 7708 metric tons of hazardous waste,19
in our certified preowned products,15
Individual sites achieved in 2021 the following hazardous waste reductions by using improved cleaning procedures and materials,19
Eliminated 700 liters of sulfuric acid with peroxide waste,19
and 80 liters of other caustic solvents per year by eliminating unnecessary steps and utilizing alternative cleaning methods,19
Reduced solvent consumption by 17000 liters per year,24
by replacing manual wet bench with an automated wet bench process,15
Diverted 600 gallons of solvent per year,20
by installing a valve to segregate solvents during maintenance which allows waste reuse,19
Reduced solvent consumption by about 24225 liters per year,24

Were educating employees about sustainability to promote behavior change and to encourage a strong sense of ownership to ensure sustainability remains central to our culture and processes Were also educating customers about leading practices in lab sustainability and how our products and services can support their sustainability goals,15
Focusing on sustainability in the product lifecycle,15
Sustainability should be just as integrated into a products lifecycle as performance quality usability and other user benefits We will formalize criteria used to consider environmental factorsfrom energy usage and carbon emissions to waste generation and material selection and use,15
The work of the RDNPI Sustainability team builds on many years of environmental efforts at Agilent including instruments on the following pages that offer reduced energy use and waste,24
Examples of Agilent Instruments with Lower Energy Use,24
The Intuvo 9000 Gas Chromatograph,25
Uses an efficient direct heating system that requires less than half the electrical power of a conventional gas chromatography while also significantly reducing the heat energy emitted back into the lab,24
58005900 Inductively Coupled PlasmaOptical Emission Spectrometer RF generator and Main Power Module,21
Reduces the amount of electrical power required by 40 The reduced exhaust extraction means there is a lower requirement of AC that further reduces electrical power,24
8700 Laser Direct Infrared Spectrometer,24
Uses a lowpowered quantum cascade laser as its light source instead of a thermal glow bar powerful incandescent light bulb that previous versions used,24
Consumes less energy by having a xenon flash lamp that only flashes when taking a measurement By comparison standard deuteriumtungsten lamps remain on continuously and require annual lamp replacement,24
Its electronics enable direct communication and full control of the turbopump through the Vacuum Link mobile App The control system continuously monitors the pump working parameters for the application selfadjusting power and temperatures and minimizing energy waste,19
Examples of Instruments with Reduced Hazardous Waste,19
InfinityLab Supercritical Fluid Chromatography Solutions,24
Oilfree vacuum pumps for GCMS are clean green and affordable completely removing the need to use any oil in the analytical process,24
Dimensions of inner diameter ID length and particle size are reduced to lower solvent consumption up to 86 and analysis time up to 67 per analysis,24
The 1260 Infinity II SFCUHPLC Hybrid System and the 1260 Infinity II SFC System provide low solvent consumption and less waste for true green chemistry through uses of food grade CO2 instead of hazardous solvents,19
Stops harmful solvents from evaporating into the lab air protecting workers in the lab environment,21
By increasing nebulization efficiency and with a low uptake rate the OneNeb universal nebulizer can reduce acid and reagent volumes used for sample preparation and therefore reduce waste compared to conventional nebulizers,19
Examples of Instruments with Reduced Nonhazardous Waste,19
Transmission Raman is a nondestructive technique performing solidstate analysis on tablets capsules and powders without the need for solvent extraction,6
8900 Inductively Coupled Plasma QQQ triple quad Mass Spectrometer,24
Increased the use of recyclable materials such as plastic components High matrix tolerance lowers the need for sample dilution resulting in less waste to dispose of Low flow sample introduction reduces reagent use and volume of waste for disposal,19
Cary 630 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer,24
The Cary 630 FTIR Dialpath and Tumblir accessories eliminate the need for liquid cells Less volume of the sample means significant reduction of cleaning agent and rinsing solvent waste,19
When the Agilent RDNPI Council was formed in 2019 the group searched for industry initiatives and green certifications that provide independent standards and validation for sustainable lab products,14
This led to forming a partnership in 2019 with My Green Lab a nonprofit organization run by scientists for scientists to build a global culture of sustainability in science My Green Labs flagship programs Green Lab Certification and the Accountability Consistency and Transparency ACT Label for Laboratory products are designed to address the resource intensive nature of labs The ACT label is the first econutrition label for the laboratory supplies industry The ACT label provides scores on the environmental impact of manufacturing using and disposing of a product and its packaging so customers can make betterinformed sustainable choices,15
Agilent was the first company to have highend lab instrumentation assessed for the ACT label which now includes about 30 of our instruments accounting for approximately 1 billion in revenue This includes some of our largest product families in liquid chromatography LC mass spectrometry MS and gas chromatography GC Agilent products with the ACT label can be found on the My Green Lab ACT database,15
My Green Lab has certified 700 labs in 30 different countries and we are proud to be their sponsor in this effort One of our top priorities is ensuring that our customers can reduce their environmental impact without sacrificing quality and offering laboratory supply chain instruments with My Green Labs ACT label is an essential part of this effort,17
Agilent is proud to be the first Transformative Level sponsor of the My Green Lab Certification program,14
In 2021 the UN selected My Green Lab certification as a key indicator of progress for its Climate Change UNFCCC HighLevel Climate Champions 2030 Breakthroughs campaign The campaign established 2030 targets needed across 30 sectors to achieve netzero emissions by 2050 One of the industry targets calls for 95 of labs across major pharmaceutical and medical technology companies to achieve My Green Lab Green level certification by 2030,13
Reusing and Recycling Our Instruments and Parts,15
To reduce the amount of waste of our instruments we offer our customers the ability to tradein an instrument for a new one sell a preowned instrument back to us and return decommissioned instruments to us for recycling even if it was purchased from another vendor,19
The program includes most of our product lines including the following instrument families,15
For preowned instruments in good condition we inspect refurbish and resell those that meet our strict quality control measures through our Agilent Certified PreOwned Instruments program For instruments that cannot be refurbished to our high standard we reuse parts in good condition and recycle as much as possible,15

Welcoming feedback recognizing our successes and,8
This culture is underpinned by values we reinforce through leadership practices training at all levels and communication Those values include trust respect teamwork innovation contribution and uncompromising integrity We emphasize this along with speed focus and accountability,0
Our employees are engaged and passionate And thats evident in our resultsour consistent growth the innovative new products we launch and our excellence in the customer experience But we also see it in the feedback we received last year directly from our employees Each year we conduct an indepth anonymous third party engagement survey of our global workforce We conducted this survey in spring of 2021 and a large majority of employees responded88 of the workforce a total of 14642 team members a similar percentage as the prior year This rate is considered well above the industry average We also scored above the 90th percentile compared with hundreds of comparable companies that surveyed their employees on similar topics,8
Employees were asked to rate leaderships performance on a number of questions Below are the results for each thematic area,8
Believe we have the right strategy,3
Feel we have the right team,8
Say we have the right environment,10
Among the most important results in a job market where competition for talent is high 87 of Agilent employees reported being highly engaged and 90 would recommend Agilent as a great place to work We registered our highest scores on questions related to workplace culture 94 percent are motivated by Agilents mission and vision and feel supported by their manager in making decisions about their health and wellbeing,9
We also ranked high on diversity and inclusion 92 feel Agilent enables people from diverse backgrounds to excel and 92 feel managers and employees value diversity and inclusion And even as the prior 15 months brought unprecedented challenges to our work and personal lives 97 of employees agreed that Agilent is doing what is necessary to support our customers during the Covid19 pandemic,8
Over the previous years survey we saw an eight increase in the share of employees who reported feeling connected to the Agilent culture And the number of employees who reported feeling highly engaged increased by 3 over the previous year,8
We also learned from our employees of ways we can continue to improve in terms of ease of doing business resourcing of business priorities and in supporting speed flexibility and innovation Our CEO shared results of the survey through an email letter sent to all employees worldwide along with steps were taking to make Agilent even stronger Those steps are outlined in an action plan developed with leaders of each business unit that identifies priority items creates short and long term strategies to address them takes actions to achieve interim milestones and shares the success when desired results are achieved,3
As the pandemic entered its second year 70 percent of our workforce continued to work from home We took concrete steps to ensure employees continued to feel supported and connected to the immediate teams and the larger company including,9
Holding annual employee Town Hall meetings quarterly,7
meetings for managers quarterly coffee chats with each division and smaller team events to build connections,8
Sponsored events within our Employee Network Groups to bring people together to hear from guest speakers around observances such as Black History Month and International Womens Day,2
Offering wellness resources including an emotional,2
wellness program design to build a safe work environment and connect employees with supportive resources when they need them,9

Flexibility to juggle caregiving duties during periods of school,2
Ongoing training for managers on how to effectively lead,2
Thank You days which are additional paid days off given to all eligible employees to reward them when strong results are achieved,11
92 said they have the tools to work productively and 91 said their physical work environment enabled them to do their job safety and effectively We also recognize that remote work will continue to be increasingly common as offices begin to open in 2022 particularly in a global labor market where competition for top talent remains strong Over the last year we have invested in equipping our conference rooms with advanced virtual meeting technology to ensure remote and inperson teams can continue to collaborate effectively,11
Part of Agilents growth is based on strategic acquisitions of innovative companies that help us advance our mission To ensure acquisitions are successful we assemble a crossfunctional team composed of human resources business systems and processes operations and communications specialists and other business functions to integrate employees of new companies into the Agilent culture and way of doing business The process includes regular meetings with senior leaders on highlevel strategy to daytoday operations a monthly newsletter and smaller group meetings to coordinate steps at each stage of the integration We also conduct regular surveys of the acquired team share results of the survey with them and show our plan for promptly addressing any questions or issues,3
Employee Engagement Through Giving and Volunteerism,10
We also engage our employees through our giving and volunteer benefits We match most charitable contributions of our employees up to 25000 per calendar year per employee and provide an online platform that makes giving easy connecting our employees to thousands of local national and international nonprofit and charitable organizations,2
Additionally we offer employees up to six paid work days of volunteer time off per calendar year to serve at eligible nonprofits of their choosing Last year our employees used this time off to serve people experiencing homelessness clean the environment and assist at Covid vaccination sites,9
We also introduced a Dollars for Doers program last year which gives an employee a 25 credit for each hour they volunteer during nonworking hours at an eligible charity The funds are then placed in an account where the employee can donate them to a nonprofit organization of their choice,2

Our employee engagement efforts contribute to strong retention rates Even during a year in which competition for talent was high and a record number of employees resigned our attrition rates were better than the industry average,8
In addition to providing programs to support our employees as we worked remotely we also provided direct support to address health and wellness within the workforce We continued to follow strict Covid19 protocols in our manufacturing and research facilities where siteessential employees continued working in person This included masking social distancing staying home when experiencing any symptoms and contact tracing that helped keep people safe while preserving individual privacy,9
We also helped our global workforce access the vaccine by holding vaccination clinics at our sites in the US as well as in countries where the vaccine was less accessible For example in Thailand a vaccine shortage caused deliveries to be delayed and most Agilent employees in Thailand saw their vaccine appointments canceled In response we arranged for doses of the vaccines to be administered to 100 employees and family members at a local hospital,2
Upon receiving the first of two vaccine shots an Agilent fieldservice engineer in Thailand remarked that I have been worried that I may get infected or bring the virus back home to my family Now my wife and I are vaccinated and I feel much more confident,9
Earlier in the year when India was experiencing a surge in cases Agilent India vaccinated more than 900 employees and family members as part of a government program to speed up vaccinations across the nation Agilent also encouraged vaccine uptake among US employees by holding information sessions with our experts on the benefits of vaccination and by hosting vaccination clinics at our facilities We also complied with all laws and regulations regarding vaccination including the vaccine mandate for federal contractors,9
Agilent delivers a total rewards portfolio that is competitive with life sciences diagnostics and applied markets companies and which is representative of the diverse industries and markets in which we operate To ensure we remain competitive each year we conduct a benchmark study that compares the combined value of Agilents base pay target pay for sales employees variable pay benefits and equity stock plan,4
with that from high technology and life sciences comparator companies The portfolio is designed to attract retain and motivate the best people producing outstanding business performance shareholder value and employee wealth creation Our total rewards portfolio includes compensation equity and benefits received as an Agilent employee,8
Compensation includes base pay variable pay such as the One Agilent Bonus and sales incentive compensation The One Agilent Bonus consists of a companywide Results Bonus that is tied to the growth and shareholder value we created that year The Individual Performance Bonus is varied discretionary and designed to recognize and reward individual contributions When Agilent does well we ensure our employees also share in that prosperity,11
Benefits such as health and welfare benefits retirement plans and time off provide a foundation to support employee wellbeing and financial security Equity programs align employee and shareholder interests Programs include an Employee Stock Purchase Plan and longterm incentives such as restricted stock units,11
Generally parttime employees who meet minimum requirements for benefits eligibility are eligible for the same benefits as fulltime employees Benefits and eligibility requirements vary by country,11
Last year we developed a hybrid work model for employees who can effectively perform their job from home or another remote location We did this to respond to a growing desire during the pandemic to retain the flexibility afforded by remote working As we planned for a return to the office we wanted to offer more flexible options that balance the benefits of faceto face teamwork and collaboration with remote work flexibility The model allows employees to work from home two days a week and in the office the remaining three days We expect to fully implement this program in FY2022,11
This policy adds to a variety of benefits Agilent offers that recognize life events and when away from the job encourage employees to rest relax recharge and live a wellrounded life While specific programs vary by country examples include company holidays flexible time off leaves of absence and gifts to celebrate life events such as marriage and the birth or adoption of a child,2
Agilents flexible work arrangements also provide alternatives to working Monday through Friday 8 am to 5 pm With manager approval and business permitting employees can take advantage of a number of options to help juggle work and personal responsibilities,11
As a global company much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce from providing managers transparency of their workforce pay equity to working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams and promoting the advancement of leaders from different backgrounds,8

Australia Austria Belgium Brazil Canada Denmark Finland France Germany Great Britain Greater China Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Italy Japan Korea Malaysia Mexico Netherlands New Zealand Norway Singapore Spain Sweden Switzerland Thailand United States,12
Diversity goal Broaden gender racial and ethnic diversity,8
Agilents yearoveryear gender representation is moving in the right direction and the numbers for associate vice president and director roles show that we have a strong pipeline of women for future senior leadership roles,8
Even though were improving we want to do more We want our leadership levels to mirror those of the entire organization which means 40 of our leaders should be women and at least 16 should be women of color Below we show our progress to date and explain how well achieve our goals,8
Much of the past year focused on building the foundation of a strong diversity and inclusion program strategy and plan But we still made progress Below are the highlights,8
We increased the percentage of female leaders who report directly to the CEO from 10 percent in 2020 to 31 percent in 2021,8
We increased the share of women employees in leadership positions who are Black and Indigenous by 2 percentage points,8
We maintained a gender pay equity ratio of 100 throughout our global workforce,11
Agilent has a strong global pipeline of women leaders with 235 associate vice presidents and directors who will help drive representation at the senior and executive levels for years to come,8
Agilent was named one of the top 100 femalefriendly companies in the world an honor that reflects how well companies support women inside and outside their workforces As of October 31 2021 approximately 39 of our fulltime employees were female Our commitment to pay equity has been consistent over many years and has remained stable at a near 10 ratio,11
2020 Female to Male Ratio,8
2021 Female to Male Ratio,8
We target a gender compensation ratio of 10 meaning men and women in similar roles with similar responsibilities are paid equally With our new HR information system we can now analyze pay by race and ethnicity in the US in addition to gender delivering greater insight into our organizations pay equity,11
Five Pillars that Define Agilents Culture and Values,3
Our strategy to attract and retain highquality candidates is supported by five pillars that define Agilent culture and values,0
In 2021 we broadened our operational metrics and expanded the development and engagement of our employee population at every stage We believe this model will allow us to have even greater global impact while allowing for customization based on local needs,8
We also believe this model will help nurture a One Agilent inclusive culture that drives an exceptional employee experience throughout the full life cycle of employment,8
Attract Develop deploy efforts to identify and hire diverse talent,8
Retain Build inclusive teams and support the worker experience,8
Engage Cultivate a sense of organizational belonging,8
Develop Introduce inclusive leadership develop cultural competence,8
Highlight Give diverse talent access visibility to leaders,8
To expand our pipeline of racially diverse candidates Agilents recruiting team has partnered with HBCU Connect a social platform that provides Black Hispanic and Latino candidates in the US with networking and professional opportunities In 2021 we held recruiting events for college students and recent graduates and we expanded our recruiting targets to include professionals and alumni,8
Customized strategies with common goals,6
While the tactical elements of each pillar are consistent worldwide we customize them to each local region to drive impact For example in the US Agilent has partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities to reach their alumni whereas in China our recruiting efforts focus on attracting more gender diversity In the UK and Brazil we are working to attract individuals from underrepresented categories such as professionals with disabilities and those early in their careers,8
We might also vary our tactics by encouraging our global recruiters to use the platforms their audiences are most familiar with We create specialized content for each market and use the appropriate platform for the geography In the end these policies allow all Agilent sites to remain aligned with our corporate initiatives while maintaining flexibility in meeting the needs of our diverse candidates all around the world,4
How we measure and define success,4
We use a range of straightforward measures to define success for every pillar For instance we measure how well were attracting diverse candidates through representation rates and newhire representation We measure our efforts to retain through Diversity Index results and monitor voluntary attrition by demographic as an engagement data point,8
Another important data point in measuring our DI performance is the annual employee survey which asks a series of questions about the diversity and inclusion climate at Agilent,8
In 2021 we broadened our engagement survey architecture to allow us to analyze the results by race gender and ethnicity This allows us to better understand and address the challenges that underrepresented minorities may face within the organization In the aggregate our engagement survey results are strong Yet after parsing the results by factors such as race geography and function weve found that the Agilent experience varies,8
Our goal is to achieve at least 80 on each DIrelated question across all demographics,4
Unconscious bias also known as implicit bias refers to assumptions that our brains make when we take mental shortcuts that can lead to errors in decision making Unconscious bias can affect who gets invited to meetings who gets credit for innovative ideas and who gets interrupted during discussions It can also affect how and who we hire To help manage our implicit biases all employees are assigned mandatory unconsciousbias training through a 90minute course administered on our online learning platform,4
Our bias can lead us to look at the same work product differently depending on who produced it the training states When someone shares an idea or makes a mistake we may evaluate those moments differently depending on who the person is,15
After requiring this training for all Agilent leaders in 2020 the feedback was so positive that we rolled it out to all Agilent employees around the world about 16000 people in 2021 Our completion rate was 98 and we are now developing formal learning paths on inclusive leadership and allyship,8
advancement opportunities for many who participated in the program And the WomenAgilent group also sponsors mentorship circles and oneon one mentorship opportunities,8
This overview of our Diversity and Inclusion efforts are just the beginning Read more about our program in our 2021 Diversity and Inclusion report,8
