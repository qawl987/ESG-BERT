Citi initiatives help to create measurable impacts for communities across the world To estimate the environmental and social impacts of Citifinanced projects and activities we looked at the following metrics,10
Avoided GHG emissions refers to the amount of GHG emissions avoided because of Citis share of financing for renewable,25
energy green affordable housing and energy efficiency projects GHG emissions avoidance is calculated by applying regional electric grid factors to Citis share of financing across three types of activities including a lowcarbon source replacing energy use from the grid energy efficiency upgrades and green housing units that are LEEDcertified Impacts reflect the per annum benefit as opposed to benefit over entire project life,24
For renewable energy projects total project capacity for energy is calculated as the annual capacity factor applied to,24
the total project size per annum and multiplied by the CO2 emissions factor,25
For energy efficiency upgrades the average household energy savings is calculated as the average household energy use multiplied by the percentage of energy savings per thousand US dollars invested The result is multiplied by the total warehouse value and the CO2 emissions factor,24
For green buildings the average household energy savings is equal to the average energy use of a nonLEEDcertified,24
building multiplied by the percentage of energy savings by a LEEDcertified building The result is multiplied by the number of square feet and the per square feet CO2 emission factor,24
Renewable energy capacity added refers to the size of new renewable energy capacity installed as a result of Citis share of,24
People impacted refers to the direct number of people benefiting from the use of Citifinanced lending activities for small,2
businesses renewable energy and energy efficiency projects affordable housing and underwritten municipal bond proceeds for transit water and education projects,24
For microfinance lending activities people impacted is equivalent to the number of entrepreneurs and small farm holders,2
receiving business loans as selfreported by Citi teams,18
For renewable energy projects and energy efficiency finance people impacted is equivalent to the number of people whose annual energy usage is supplied by the project Estimated renewable energy generation annually due to Citi financing is divided by average energy consumption per capita in the country of the project to estimate number of people impacted,24
For affordable housing the number of people impacted is calculated using external reference data on average household,2
size multiplied by the number of housing units constructed,8
For municipal bond financing related to education projects people impacted is estimated as the number of enrolled school children benefiting from new or repaired school buildings or purchases of equipment External education data on average student enrollment by school and the number of schools benefiting from funding as stated in issuance documents was used for this calculation,2
Direct jobs supported refers to the number of jobs supported by the uses of Citifinanced lending or underwritten municipal bond proceeds Jobs supported are related to Citis share of new financing for the projects For microfinance lending jobs supported are equal to the number of entrepreneurs and smallholder farmers that received loans For projects involving new construction or maintenance and repair of affordable housing units renewable energy generation schools transit or water systems in the United States jobs supported are calculated as Citifinanced expenditures divided by output per worker supplied by the IMPLAN economic modeling system For projects involving renewable energy generation in locations outside the United States external data is used to estimate the share of project cost involving installation labor and this is divided by average compensation of workers in the country to estimate jobs supported,11

We are continuing to learn about the complex dynamics between climate and biodiversity These two topics are deeply interconnected and there is an increasing awareness that climate change along with other humancaused stresses on natural systems is contributing to biodiversity loss and ongoing extinction events Natural capital is a way to conceptualize the various resources and services that are provided by resilient ecosystems This concept helps to inform the increasing focus on biodiversity its impact on climate and the importance of disclosure,23
A recent Citi Global Perspectives Solutions GPS report Biodiversity The Ecosystem at the Heart of Business explores why businesses and investors should care about biodiversity loss The report explains that businesses rely on nature for their products and ecosystem services such as clean air water pollination and carbon sequestration At the same time their operations create direct and indirect impacts on nature that can and often do negatively affect their business By failing to understand the dependencies and impacts on nature and biodiversity companies open themselves up to biodiversity risk that could affect the profitability of their businesses This in turn poses risks to their investors,23
There is a growing realization that we are losing biodiversity at an alarming rate This requires urgent action that is complementary to climate action Global wildlife populations have fallen an average of 68 in just 46 years and human activities threaten 1 million animal and plant species with extinction At the same time there is a financing gap of 598 billion to 824 billion per year for broad action on biodiversity suggesting significant business opportunities Additionally nature positive solutions can create 10 trillion in business opportunities and 395 million new jobs by 2030 These solutions could deliver up to 37 of CO2 emission reductions by 2030,23
To support our understanding and action on biodiversity we are also a member of the Taskforce on Naturerelated Financial Disclosures TNFD Forum a global and multidisciplinary consultative network of institutional supporters who share the vision and mission of the TNFD To learn more see the Risk Management section,18

Climate Risk and Net Zero,13
When we consider the risks related to climate change we apply a double materiality perspective looking at both the impact of climate change on our business and our businesss impact on the climate,13
Citis business is exposed to numerous,18
climate risks given our role as one of the,13
largest financiers of the global economy,3
means that as we address and mitigate,18
risks we must take into account how we will,18
protect and strengthen our business while,3
ensuring that our clients become part of,3
the solutions that are needed to transition,18
We prioritize regular reporting about,12
our progress and approach in relation to,10
climate risk as we believe transparently,13
sharing our journey is an important,10
contribution we can make both to the,12
broader industry and to our clients Citi,3

The first step of our net zero plan involves engagement client by client to understand each clients GHG emissions disclosure and their perspective and plans for transition Additionally we will review public disclosures climate governance and the commit ments and actions they have taken to date We anticipate that this initial review phase will continue through the end of 2023 In the following table we highlight some of the key considerations that will frame client engagement,25

During 2021 we used the PCAF methodology to conduct an analysis of our Energy and Power portfolios using 2020 data In alignment,24

The PCAF methodology is primarily focused on reporting financed emissions on an annual basis and relies on data of funds outstand,25
ing not the total funds that a financial institution may have committed to the client in the reporting year While we intend to continue,12
disclosing per the PCAF requirements to provide this annual view of financed emissions associated with our activities we are using,25
committed funds data to more holistically attribute our clients emissions for the baseline financed emissions figures in our net zero,25
plan Consequently we undertook an additional analysis of our Energy and Power loan portfolios using total committed funds to calcu,12
late baseline emissions from 2020 and establish 2030 emission targets The use of committed funds in this context provides a more,21
accurate reflection of the maximum emissionsgenerating activity that Citi has agreed to finance and is therefore better suited for the,25
purposes of forwardlooking emissions management and target setting This approach results in discrepancies between the metrics we,25
report for PCAF and for our net zero targets but we believe the committed funds approach is better aligned with the way we expect to,12
manage our net zero targets,18

To reach net zero we must move from our baseline across a decarbonization pathway to our ultimate net zero target Establishing 2030,4
targets are the first step in that journey The next step is to develop an implementation plan to achieve targeted reductions in each,12

Our reported alignment score this year 117 is notably further out of alignment compared with our reported score of last year 6 This change in alignment is due to a combination of factors including the improved accuracy of the new methodology as well as significant disruptions in shipping related to the COVID19 pandemic The disruptions were most notable in the Cruise segment which saw dramatic decreases in efficiency and therefore our alignment scores driven by reduced cruising activity globally This was however offset by the improvements in the accuracy of the methodology resulting in an alignment score of 11 for the Cargo segment of Citis Shipping portfolio only excluding the Cruise segment Further changes to the methodology may occur as data and industry practices evolve and new IMO regulations come into effect,12
To further advance progress in the maritime shipping industry we are a member of the Getting to Zero Coalition which is focused on the development of commercially viable zeroemission vessels and other needed maritime infrastructure for scalable net zerocarbon energy sources including production distribution storage and bunkering The coalition was founded by the Global Maritime Forum Friends of Ocean Action and the World Economic Forum It has more than 190 member companies and nine knowledge partners and is supported by key intergovernmental organizations and governments,24
Reducing Climate Risk in Our Financing,13
Climate risk is one of the three pillars of,13
our Sustainable Progress Strategy When,10
it comes to analyzing and reducing climate,13
risk associated with our clients we have,18
identified the following three primary,2
Our Commitment to Reduce Financing for Coal,12
Our ESRM Policy commitments related to coal mining began in 2009 with our first coal mining Sector Approach Since that time we have updated our policy including updates focused on enhanced due diligence and continued reductions in our credit exposure to the coal mining industry As of 2020 Citi has established a policy prohibition on project related financing of new thermal coal mines and significant expansions We have also committed to the following targets to reduce our exposure to companies that derive 25 or more of their revenue from thermal coal mining,12
By the end of 2025 Reduce our credit exposure to these companies by 50 from,18
After 2025 No longer facilitate capital markets transactions or mergers and acquisition,4
As part of our work to integrate climate,13
advisory and financing for these companies,12
risk into Citis risk policies and governance,12
By the end of 2030 Reduce all remaining exposure to these companies to zero,18
frameworks we have updated our ESRM,12
Policy Sector Approaches for carbon,12
intensive sectors to incorporate emerging,17
best practices One area where we have,3
made significant progress is in our fossil,3
fuel Sector Approaches for thermal coal,24
mining and the generation of coalfired,5
power which predated our net zero,4
commitment See the box on the right for,10

Citi aims to understand the transition and,3
physical risks that Citi and our clients are,18

portfolios to establish baseline emissions,25
and establish interim 2030 emissions,25
targets as we work toward our net zero,4
commitment Learn more about this,8
Credit exposure as of Dec 31 2021,18
CoalFired Power Generation Our ESRM Policy commitments related to coalfired power generation have also been updated over time as the credit and reputation risk related to coal has increased We have committed to not finance any new coalfired power plants or expansions of existing plants Our expectations have increased as we aim to help our clients transition to a future aligned with the Paris Agreement A comprehensive summary of timebound milestones for coalfired power clients through 2040 is available in our Environmental and Social Policy Framework,12
In 2021 we reviewed our coalfired power clients GHG reporting and lowcarbon transition plans including commitments to retire existing coal plants Our analysis considered a combination of client disclosures thirdparty ESG analysis CDP disclosures and direct client engagement Moving forward this evaluation will be wrapped into our net zero engagement and progress towards our 2030 targets,25

based on a qualitative assessment of how,12
Climate Risk HeatMapping Framework Vulnerability Rubric,13
Our climate risk heat map included on the following pages categorizes sectors under one of four vulnerability scores ranging from,13
low to high We have established subscores using the rubric in the following table for various aspects of transition and physical risks,18
No regulatorypolicy changes are expected to meaningfully impact the sector financially such as through asset devaluation increased expenditure eg compliance costs andor loss of revenue,12
Outside of general modernization of tech nology no technology shifts are expected for the sector,18
Minor impact to the sector expected from potential regulatorypolicy changes eg building efficiency resulting in financial impact asset devaluation increased expenditure eg compliance costs or loss of revenue impact only on a subset of the sector subset of geographies andor only indirect impact,12
Moderate impact to the sector expected from regulatorypolicy changes eg carbon taxes relating to the sectors carbon intensity direct impact with noticeable economic implications on the sector through impacted asset valuation increased expenditure eg compliance costs andor revenue loss,12
Minor impact to the sector expected from technology changes ie impact only on a small subset of the sector or only indirect impact through supply chain that result in market share loss,17
Moderate impact to the sector expected from technology changes resulting in some shift in the economics of some companies in the sector leading to market share loss,18
Major impact to the sector expected due to expected regulatory policy changes relating to the sectors carbon intensity significant shift expected in the business model or economics of the sector impacting asset valuation expenditures eg increased compliance costs andor revenue,12
Major impact to the sector expected from technology changes resulting in substitution of a significant portion of existing companies ie market share loss,18
There is no expectation of stakeholder composition or preferences changing for the industry,4
Minor stakeholder impact due to expected shift in preferences with minor financial impact on companies eg revenue vendor pricing,4
Moderate stakeholder impact is expected for the sector in terms of stakeholder preferences and composition with modest financial impact eg revenue vendor pricing,4
Major stakeholder impact is expected in terms of both client preferenc es and composition of stakeholders resulting in significant financial impact eg revenue loss vendor pricing,12
No increased litigation concerns are expected to impact the industry that would lead to increased financial burden eg legal fees settlements,12
Acute physical hazards have no impact on the day today operations of companies in the sector,9
Minor litigation concerns are expected to impact the sector with minor financial consequences eg legal fees settlements,12
Moderate litigation concerns are expected to impact the sector with modest financial impact eg legal fees settlements,12
Major litigation is expected to impact the sector with significant financial impact eg legal fees settlements,12
Sector would experience minor impact from acute physical hazards on operations eg revenue loss due to business disruption or minor damage to assets eg asset devaluation,18
Sector would experience moderate and protracted impact from acute physical hazards on operations eg revenue loss due to business disruption or moderate damage to assets eg asset devaluation,18
Sector would experience major and protracted im pact from acute physical hazards on operations eg revenue loss due to business disruption or significant damage to assets eg asset devaluation,18
Chronic physical hazards have no impact on the operations or valuation of assets companies in the sector,9
Chronic physical hazards have minor potential impact on the operations eg increased insurance cost or valuation of assetscompanies in the sector,9
Sector would experience moderate and sustained impact on the operations eg increased insur ance cost or valuation of assetscompanies in the sector,18
Sector would experience major and irreversible impact on the operations or valuation of assets companies in the sector,18
Climate Risk Heat Map and Credit Exposure,13
A comprehensive table of our credit exposures is provided below including a breakdown of identified sectors into subsectors and,18
for each the level of risk relating to physical and transition climate risk By looking at the subsector level we can further distinguish,13
between the levels of risk within an individual sector It is important to note that these risks are not expected to manifest in every sector,18
immediately For this reason the table on this page and the next should not be interpreted as imminent risks to existing exposures but,18
rather exposures we are proactively identifying to focus on where we will work methodically in the coming years to better understand,18
analyze and manage our climate risk exposures in these sectors,13
Oil Gas Equipment Services Drilling,25
Independent Power Producers Service Operators,12
Over medium to long term In addition to this exposure Citi has energyrelated exposure within other sectors for example mainly energyrelated stateowned entities within the public sector Citi total exposure to these energyrelated sectors is approximately 58 billion of which approximately 33 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans as of December 31 2020 Includes Infrastructure Logistics Not Assigned and Logistics Suppliers,17
Over medium to long term Based on Citis Risk Industry Classification which only captures companies that fully identify as coal companies and excludes diversified mining companies with coal mining This differs from how Citi defines thermal coal mining companies under its ESRM Policy those that derive 25 of revenue from thermal coal mining which broadens the scope of companies covered under the ESRM Policy Includes Coke Diversified Metals Mining Industrial Minerals Energy Minerals Gold Metals Mining Not Assigned Metals Mining Related and Uranium Includes Asset Managers and Funds Banks Finance Companies Financial Markets Infrastructure and Securities Firms Certain countries may see high transition and physical risks based on commodities exposure and geographic location Sums may not match FY2020 10K due to rounding from increased granularity in industry breakdowns,18
Engagement with our stakeholders clients,10
and industry experts helps us to stay,12
current in our understanding of this critical,12
and evolving area of impact to strengthen,12
our management and analysis of climate,13
risk in our portfolio and to advance prog,18

With the announcement of our,3
commitment to net zero GHG emissions,25
we broadened our engagement with,12
employees across Citi including those,8
working in the areas of real estate,3
technology supply chain shared services,17
travel and facility operations Our goal was,9
to increase understanding and capabilities,2
across our organization while also gaining,3
greater insight into the full scope of our,12

again toward meeting our goals,10
This is the first year we are reporting progress against our 2025 goals We expect our progress to fluctuate as the number of people occupying,8
our facilities varies during the ongoing COVID19 pandemic,13

In the midst of a global pandemic that disproportionately affected communities of color we took a hard look at ourselves and our own contribution to the status quo We saw how we could use our power as individuals as a company and as an industry to drive a lasting transformative movement toward greater equity,5

To date the Citi Foundation has granted 72 million of its three year target to invest 100 million in community change agents advancing racial equity,8
Measurement and transparency are essential components of our efforts to advance diversity equity and inclusion both at our own bank and through our contributions to our communities and society more broadly In that spirit we committed to conduct a thirdparty racial equity audit to assess our efforts to help address the racial wealth gap in the United States through the design and implementation of Action for Racial Equity,8
Covington Burling LLP which has civil rights expertise and experience leading racial equity audits across various industries is conducting the audit The firm is gathering input from a range of stakeholders including Citi employees involved in implementing Action for Racial Equity financial institutions and other partners directly benefiting or involved in implementing the initiative and civil rights organizations that can represent the views of the customers and communities the initiative is designed to support Conducting an audit of Action for Racial Equity will help Citi assess our work and will show where we can adapt and grow to make an even more meaningful impact going forward The audit represents another step in our efforts to strengthen Citis policies and practices in order to become an anti racist institution The audit began in January 2022 and we look forward to sharing the findings following its expected completion at the end of 2022,10
BRIDGE BUILT BY CITI SM,18

things have always been done We have leveraged the,0
expertise of professionals at our bank to create a,8
Minority depository institutions MDIs have long been the trusted source of banking and access to capital for communities of color For generations they have provided essential financial services especially for Black Americans who have not had equitable access to the mainstream banking system and therefore had fewer opportunities to build generational wealth,8
Research shows that compared with other financial institutions MDIs originate a greater share of mortgages to borrowers of color They also originate a greater share of small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration to entrepreneurs of color than other financial institutions,18
But since 2001 the number of Blackowned and operated banks has declined by more than half As of September 2021 there were only 20 Black banking institutions and only one of them held more than 1 billion of assets,18
One of the four goals of Action for Racial Equity is expanding banking and access to credit in communities of color in part through collaboration with MDIs During Citi focus groups with Black MDIs leaders overwhelmingly prioritized access to capital and capacity building investments to grow their revenue and operations which would enable the MDIs to diversify products and expand services,8
Our collaboration with Unity National Bank is just one example of how were offering expertise and guidance to MDIs We have supported growth capital opportunities for Unity by providing an equity investment and inviting Unity in on select projectbased affordable housing lending opportunities including a loan for 381 affordable housing units in Texas,2
We also onboarded Unity on the Bridge built by CitiSM platform to help expand their customer base and we have enabled Unity to gain contractbased revenue as a subcontractor on existing Citi federal business lines In order to help Unity prepare for longterm growth were collaborating on shared media and client conversations and supporting talent acquisition by exposing highachieving students of color to banking as a career Further pro bono technical assistance delivered in collaboration with Deloitte and the National Bankers Association is helping Unity to strengthen access to talent pipeline development initiatives and corporate board seats,8
In 2021 we doubled down on our collaboration with Unity by piloting the Citi Rotational Program which embedded a Citi executive at Unity with the mandate of supporting revenue generation through the New Markets Tax Credit Program and expanding their affordable housing work,12

In December 2021 the Foundation announced 50 nonprofit organizations as the newest recipients of unrestricted grants to advance social and economic opportunity for underserved communities The 25 million grant initiative supports visionary organizations that are working to connect lowincome communities and communities of color to greater social and economic opportunity in six cities Chicago Los Angeles Miami New York San Francisco and Washington DC Each Community Progress Maker will receive an unrestricted grant of 500000 and access to technical assistance and a facilitated supportive learning community,2
The recipients are working on a range of social issues including the expansion of affordable housing and access environmental sustainability economic development financial health and wellness and workforce readinesshighquality jobs The Foundation will provide a supportive community network through which these organizations can connect to learn from each other share best practices and strengthen their roles as social change agents As part of the initiative the Citi Foundation is engaging longtime grantee Urban Institute to provide technical assistance to the cohort helping to measure their impact and track their progress,10
According to a recent report from Citi Global Perspectives Solutions there is a growing need for multiyear unrestricted funding which empowers nonprofits to invest in the financial sustainability of their organization and gives them the flexibility to adapt to evolving challenges This kind of philanthropic support is even more urgent as local communities continue to face complex challenges posed by the COVID19 pandemic,2

Having an opportunity to recharge or step away from work can boost job productivity and morale In 2021 we rolled out two new programs to do just that for those who have been employed by Citi for at least five years,11
Our Refresh Recharge Reenergize sabbatical program allows colleagues to take up to 12 weeks away from work to pursue personal interests or education take extended travel or simply take time off Employees will receive 25 of their base pay do not have to provide an explanation or reason for taking a break and are eligible for two sabbaticals during their full tenure at Citi In the first year of the program which was launched in 2021 more than 200 employees began to take sabbatical,11

approached them with the idea to,4

in Canada Working remotely and,17
the pandemic have been very challenging for many in the Asian,13

business conversation I am a firm believer that as an employee,11
I need to set an example on how with the right level of support,12
from my amazing managers over the years I was able to grow,8
my career and begin to ask not what Citi can do for me but,3
what can I do for Citi and the disability community I have been,8
working with various groups and technology experts to raise the,12
understanding on how assistive technology enables inclusion By,8
being myself I have allowed my managers to be their very best for,8
me and together we can work on what we need to do to support,10

colleagues who participated in Network initiatives,10
continuously share feedback that they experience,2
great value and learnings from our content I am,2
especially fond of sessions where safe spaces are,9
created to speak up Inviting people to talk about,10
topics relating to diversity equity and inclusion,8
increases awareness so we can break down barriers,2
and enable people to be comfortable with certain,8
topics This helps create an understanding of the role,10
we can all play in supporting one another,4
Our Employee Networks in Action 2021 continued,8
The value Ive gotten from the Pride Network is the ability to,8
see not only tangible and measurable results from our networks,12
projects as we progressed but also the positive and proactive,10
feedback from folks who have benefited from our efforts Hearing,12
from both senior leaders and LGBTQ people on their beneficial,8
experiences and how this has impacted their work lives has,8
made all the difference Being able to connect with colleagues,8

exercise started in 2020 and completed,12
in 2021 to review the issues raised in the,12
consent orders and define the gap between,12
where we were and where we need to be,3
Following the gap analysis we designed a,12
roadmap to get us to our target state The,12
roadmap comprises several distinct areas,23
that feed into Citis integrated vision of,3
One of the first actions we undertook in,12
2021 was to develop and roll out a new,12
Enterprise Risk Management Framework to,18
assess risk across our enterprise The inte,18
grated approach of the framework seeks to,12
drive consistency across key areas of risk,18
strengthening the way the firm identifies,12
measures and monitors risk so that we,18
can implement appropriate controls and,12
helps bring consistency and structure to,4

ASSESSING OUR CULTURE OF ETHICS,0
Hearing from employees is one important way we assess the strength of ethics and accountability across our company As part of Citis annual Voice of the Employee survey we include an Ethical Culture Index to gather feedback from employees about the following items,0
Comfort with reporting unethical practices without fear of reprisal,0
when in doubt employees should always err,0
A feeling of accountability to identify and escalate issues,0
Confidence that Citi will act upon reported legal or ethical violations,0
A belief that colleagues act with integrity,0
Manager encouragement of ethical conduct even in the face of pressure,0
Index results stayed stable in 2021 with 91 of our employees responding positively to the index We will continue to listen to our employees and raise the bar in this area,11

Citi shares with employees the results of ethics investigations including a summary of corrective actions through a quarterly communication called the Spotlight on Ethics This communication reinforces for employees that their concerns are investigated and highlights commonplace areas in which ethical lapses can occur In 2021 the Spotlight on Ethics focused on select risk areas such as protecting information from inappropriate uses the prohibition on using unapproved communication methods to conduct Citi business preventing retaliation or the suppression of concerns and the requirement to cooperate with appropriately authorized internal or external investigations,0

PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY AND ADDRESSING RESETTLEMENT CONCERNS IN PANAMA CITY,23
In 2021 Citi in coordination with other financial institutions closed a 2 billion transaction to finance Metro Line 3 an expansion of Panama Citys metro system Citi worked with Consorcio HPH a consortium of Korean companies responsible for the construction of Metro Line 3 Because this is a projectrelated corporate loan for more than 50 million due diligence processes required an independent review before the close of the transaction Consorcio HPH and the lenders engaged environmental and social consultant ERM to evaluate the projects environmental and social impacts and benchmark management plans against international standards This due diligence revealed two primary risks related to the project potential biodiversity impacts and physicaleconomic displacement of individuals and businesses along the path of the new metro line,10
To address biodiversity concerns and align the project with IFC Performance Standard 6 for biodiversity ERM performed a Critical Habitat Assessment to study potential impacts on migratory andor congregatory species within the projects area of influence ERM identified an Important Bird Area including habitat for species such as the broadwinged hawk Swainsons hawk and turkey vulture The assessment revealed that a small area of Critical Habitat 054 hectare would be directly impacted by the project In order to ensure a net gain of critical habitat and no netloss of natural habitat Consorcio HPH will implement reforestation and biodiversity monitoring programs to measure results,23
After a review of impacts related to resettlement and livelihood displacement it was determined that the projects need for resettlement would be minimal Nonetheless Consorcio HPH is working with Metro de Panama SA MPSA to ensure that proper protocols are followed when engaging with residents about the need for resettlement attaining willing seller consent providing adequate compensation and developing livelihood restoration plans for those who may be impacted MPSA is also working with a social consultant to enhance its local resettlement process to align with international best practice including the IFC Performance Standard 5 for resettlement As an additional precaution the projects construction schedule is tied to review by ERM and the lenders to ensure that resettlement risks are fully assessed and benchmarked before construction begins in areas where resettlement or displacement may occur,10

Eliminating Overdraft Fees for Our Customers Financial Wellness,12
Citi recently announced plans to eliminate overdraft fees returned item fees and overdraft protection transfer fees for US Retail Banking consumers by Summer 2022 This makes Citi the only topfive US bank based on assets to completely eliminate these fees and it demonstrates our commitment to expanding access to inclusive banking products and services that can help advance economic progress especially for underbanked and unbanked populations,2
For 20 years we have put measures in place to minimize overdraft fees for our consumers in order to put their financial wellness first In addition to the upcoming changes Citi will also continue to offer a robust suite of overdraft protection transfer services for our consumers including,0
Overdraft Protection Transfer Services Citi offers two services that help consumers avoid checking account overdrafts and retutrned items Safety Check and Checking Plus variable rate line of credit The fees associated with these services will also be eliminated,0
Access Account Package Citis industryleading checkless account package with low or avoidable monthly charges provides,12
consumers with a simple transparent way to manage their finances and systemically limits pointofsale ATM and ACH transactions that could cause negative balances,18
Common Sense Protection Measures Citi will not authorize ATM or pointofsale debit transactions in cases when funds are not available,12
Low Balance Alerts Consumers can enroll in Low Balance Alerts via their account online or through the Citi Mobile App,18
The elimination of overdraft fees complements many of our firmwide Action for Racial Equity efforts in the United States that aim to expand banking and credit for communities of color,8
CITIS TREATING CUSTOMERS FAIRLY PRINCIPLES,0

ELEVATING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS FOR ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE,12
Over the last several years there has been growing global acknowledgment that climate change is a human rights issue In 2021 the UN Human Rights Council recognized the right to a healthy environment as a standalone human right Citi has also recognized for many years the right to a healthy environment and the need to evaluate the potential environmental risks to communities surrounding the industrial developments we finance For example due diligence related to environmental justice concerns is critical for identifying projects with significant impacts to local communities from fossilfuelrelated activities including extraction refinement and transportation or air and water pollution due to heavy industry,13
Environmental justice is also important as we consider lowcarbon projects with positive environmental benefits that might have negative impacts on local communities For example a dam construction project to create renewable hydroelectric power could threaten human rights if it is sited without consideration of the rights of Indigenous or other marginalized peoples While we want to champion projects that help combat climate change we need to keep our eyes open to other adverse impacts that may occur particularly in relation to already marginalized communities,10
As of 2020 we formalized environmental justice as a specific risk within the Areas of High Caution section of our ESRM Policy that triggers enhanced due diligence,12
Citis rigorous human rights policies standards and due diligence practices guide our business and lending decisions We consistently engage with our employees suppliers peers and industry experts as well as civil society organizations focused on our clients and the projects we finance to advance the protection of human rights,10
Our Commitment to Respect Human Rights,10

Addressing Forced Labor in Malaysia,11
Migrant laborers have the potential to become the victims of forced labor practices due largely to the significant debt they incur through the process of recruitment obtaining travel documentation and gaining entry into a foreign country During 2021 this issue gained heightened attention due to the increased focus of the US Customs and Border Patrol on migrant working conditions with the agency issuing a number of Withhold Release Orders refusing entry of products into the US market that were suspected of being made in whole or in part by forced labor This included several Malaysian companies involved in the manufacture of personal protective equipment and palm oil products,11
When migrant workers arrive in Malaysia they sometimes find that the salaries they earn are too low to cover the cost of repaying recruitment fees and expenses Compounding the problem their employers often withhold employee identity documents This can put migrant workers in a precarious position as they are dependent on their job to repay their debts and if they face challenging working conditions they may be unable to look for other employment given the inaccessibility of their work permits and identity documents,11
Citi has a longstanding prohibition against providing financing to any company that uses forced labor practices as defined by the ILOs 11 Forced Labour Indicators The Citi Malaysia team partnered with our global ESRM team to conduct a portfolio review in Malaysia to determine which Citi clients may have higher risk for potential forced labor practices and whether those clients have policies and procedures in place to address that risk Out of hundreds of corporate and subsidiary client relationships reviewed we identified 29 in higherrisk sectors with high migrant labor employee populations that required enhanced ESRM due diligence to assess client practices against international labor practices In situations where this review uncovered high risks that were not adequately addressed through company policies and practices or when credible accusations of forced labor existed we engaged those clients on improvements needed When necessary we required clients to bring in labor rights experts to audit and suggest improvements for their policies and procedures and we set up regular meetings to assess progress to close these gaps,11
While this is an important step we also acknowledge that due to the long history of precarious migrant labor working conditions in Malaysia and in other countries that rely on similar systems it will take time and continued work to raise awareness to change ingrained practices With this in mind Citi Malaysia and the ESRM team took an additional step to educate clients and raise awareness by working with a forced labor expert to develop a webinar for our Malaysian clients This webinar focused on international standards based on the ILOs Forced Labour Indicators risk identification methodologies and best practices for preventing forced labor in corporate operations and supply chains such as employer payment of recruitment fees reimbursement of debt ethical recruitment procedures employee access to identity documents and proper pay overtime management and grievance mechanisms More than 100 clients in Malaysia attended this webinar and it was very well received,11

Additionally under our US Commercial,12
Firearms Policy adopted in 2018 we,12
require clients or partners that are,0
US firearms retailers or firearms,16
manufacturers that sell through US,15
retail channels to adhere to a set of best,4
practices regarding the sale of firearms,16
For retailers these practices include,15
selling firearms only to individuals who,0
have completed a background check not,0
selling highcapacity magazines or bump,4
firearms to fire faster at rates comparable,24
to fully automatic firearms and selling,4
firearms to individuals under age 21 only if,8
they have received firearms safety training,14
eg as part of active or former military or,23
law enforcement employment or via hunter,8

our due diligence and risk mitigation first,18
in which the link between our financial,18
in areas where the risk of adverse human,9
services and human rights impacts is less,10

direct That complexity may mean we have,4
perspective of the people who may be,10
less leverage and it diminishes our ability,4
to ensure that ontheground outcomes,12
are consistent with Citis values In these,4
instances we work to improve our clients,12
awareness and business practices In,0
addition where a transactions financial,12
and legal structure allows it we put loan,12
covenants in place and monitor mitigation,12
efforts through our ESRM systems and,1
Due Diligence in Client Transactions,12
Citi has thousands of corporate and insti,18
tutional clients The UN Guiding Principles,10
We use our ESRM Policy where applicable,12
to assess and manage risks consis,18

against a common set of standards,12

including the UN Guiding Principles on,10

Protection of Indigenous Rights in Latin America,10
Citi understands that Indigenous Peoples distinct identities languages beliefs cultural values lands and use of natural resources may be under threat representing a higher degree of vulnerability Activities that may impact Indigenous People have long been acknowledged as an Area of High Caution under our ESRM Policy and require enhanced due diligence,10
In 2021 we put additional emphasis on the evaluation of our Latin American oil and gas clients and mining clients during new trans actions and annual credit reviews to continue identifying clients with operations that may overlap Indigenous territories All clients were assessed on their community engagement and biodiversity management practices When overlap with Indigenous territories was identified Citi engaged clients to assess how they incorporated free prior and informed consent into their engagement practices with Indigenous Peoples,10
Identifying Human Rights Risks in Transactions,10
Citis ESRM team screens transactions under the ESRM Policy for potential human rights risks The specific types of human rights risks we screen for are outlined in the table below Further data related to ESRM Policy screening can be found in the Environmental and Social Risk Management section,10
When human rights risks are identified for a projectrelated transaction during screening the ESRM team may either decline to approve the oppor tunity outright if the risks are deemed too high to address or we may outline what further due diligence would be needed for the transaction to proceed There are a number of reasons why initial opportunities may not move forward including a client declining to move forward with our due diligence review requirements,10
If an opportunity progresses to the due diligence phase our requirements include gaining access to project information that allows us to benchmark according to relevant standards such as the IFC Performance Standards UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights ILO Forced Labour Indicators and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights among other international human rights norms In projectrelated lending this due diligence would be supported by a qualified independent consultant In circumstances where a project is not aligned with applicable international standards we will not approve financing until we are satisfied that the client has appropriate plans and capacity to mitigate project risks For example in 2021 we declined a projectrelated financing opportunity for an industrial agricultural project in Africa with concerns related to involun tary resettlement child labor and biodiversity impacts,10
For general corporatelevel transactions eg renewing revolving credit facilities issuing corporate bonds that have elevated human rights risks we have less direct leverage than in projectrelated financing but we review our clients policies and practices relevant to human rights issues to evaluate their ability to avoid manage and minimize these risks We also engage our clients to understand their implementation of those policies and whether they have appropriate staffing to manage these issues and we review and encourage strong disclosures of human rights policies,10
Human Rights Risks Screened During Transaction Reviews,10
Conflict Risk Projectinduced conflict risk which may be tied to competition for resources or land,4
Cultural Heritage Properties and sites of archaeological historical cultural artistic and religious significance unique environmental features and cultural knowledge intangible forms of culture embodying traditional lifestyles,23
Environmental Justice Potential environmental risks to historically marginalized communities especially surrounding industrial developments,10
Indigenous Peoples Concerns regarding the extent to which Indigenous communities are consulted during project development and have consented to impacts to their land livelihood and cultural heritage,10
Labor Risks Risks related to labor forces used in the construction of projects or other operations including those associated with forced labor child labor and human trafficking by project operators and their subcontractors,11
Resettlement Resettlement of local communities including Indigenous groups as necessary for project implementation requires resettlement action plans and should include efforts to gain the free prior and informed consent of Indigenous communities,10
Security Practices Concerns about how project sponsors engage with public or private security forces protecting project sites,1
