Our values flow through the technology we make the way we make it and how we care for people and the planet we share These values accessibility education environment inclusion and diversity privacy and supplier responsibility are central to our ESG approach And we go further to address a comprehensive set of critical issues that matter to our company and to our stakeholders,8
From our commitment to human rights to our 2030 environmental goals ESG topics are deeply interconnected We can make the biggest impact only when we understand how these issues relate to one another,10
ESG priorities are managed across Apple and our senior leaders play an important role in integrating ESG into functions across the company We listen to stakeholders including our people suppliers communities shareholders and other external groups to understand the issues they care about And we measure our ESG progress across our business so that we can work toward being more transparent with each year,10
Above all were always working to leave the world better than we found it and to create powerful tools thatempower others to do the same,4
Weve been carbon neutral for our own operations since 2020 including business travel and employee commute and are progressing toward an urgent goal to be carbon neutral across our entire business including the full life cycle of our products by 2030 Were on an ambitious journey to one day make our products using only recycled or renewable materials We design our products to be safe for anyone who assembles uses or recycles them and to be better for the environment At the same time were partnering with communities and local leaders and working to make sure our environmental efforts are also a force for equity and justice,15
Since 2018 Apple sources all of the electricity for its facilities from,24
100 percent renewable energy The Montague Wind Farm in Oregon,24
is one of Apples largest projects at 200 megawatts and powers,24
At Apple we work every day to put people first by empowering them with accessible technology being a force for equity and opportunity creating an inclusive and diverse work environment and respecting the human rights of everyone whose lives we touch,10
Were committed to inclusion and diversity for our team and in our world And we have programs and benefits to support the development of our team members We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our teams customers supplier employees and communities,8
Suppliers We hold ourselves and our suppliers to the highest standards of labor and human rights health and safety environmental protections and ethics Were working every day to support more people in our supply chain and surrounding communities And were collaborating with others to promote best practices and scale innovative solutions,11
Labor and human rights in the supply chain,11
Were focused on infusing our values into our products engineering privacy and security into everything we make and designing our products and services to be accessible to and inclusive of the widest range of users We also find innovative ways to support peoples education health and a range of human rights topics with a specific focus on communities too often denied opportunities,1
Communities Were accelerating social change by supporting communities and organizations that are addressing societys toughest problems including a focus on communities of color Some of our key initiatives include the Racial Equity and Justice Initiative REJI Community Education Initiative Developer Academies Entrepreneur Camp and affordable housing initiative Our corporate donations support nonprofits and other organizations with which we partner and we empower employees to contribute to the causes they care about through our Employee Giving program,10
Racial Equity and Justice Initiative,8
We embed transparency and accountability at every level of our company Apples board and governance structure helps foster principled actions informed and effective decision making and appropriate monitoring of our compliance and performance Were committed to conducting business ethically honestly and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations,0

Were committed to helping address shared global challenges Thats why we engage with public policy and the legal system when we identify an opportunity to support the rights and wellbeing of our people customers communities andplanet,10
Advocating for strong climate policies,13
Apples climate policy advocacy centers on several principles each of which govern Apples public policy positions on climate Set strong targets based on science disclose comprehensive emissions create sector specific policies and support a green economy for all,13
In April 2021 we made a public statement calling for mandatory disclosures of global greenhouse gases across all emissions scopes The statement also focused the discussion within industry and government toward greater transparency and increased attention by regulators,25
In May 2021 Apple also became one of the first companies to voice support for the enactment of the Clean Energy Standard CES that would decarbonize the power grid by 2035 And at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties COP26 in Glasgow Scotland in 2021 Apple called for bold government action on climate change joining several new initiatives including the First Movers Coalition the Forest Investor Club and the Clean Energy Demand Initiative,13
We also advocate for countryspecific measures that motivate climate action For example weve called for enhanced climate ambition and renewable energy deployment in Japans Basic Energy Plan and Nationally Determined Contribution Japans plan to reduce emissions in furtherance of the Paris Agreement and for,13

decarbonization policies to prioritize support for new technologies that can fully account for reducing emissions across their life cycle,24
We believe that every person should be treated with dignity and respect and we speak out publicly in ways that reflect our values As just one recent example weve continued our public support for LGBTQ equality by working with The Human Rights Campaign and other organizations to support LGBTQ equality protections and oppose discriminatory proposals This includes legislative advocacy at the federal and state levels and working with coalitions of businesses to stand against what we believe to be harmful and divisive legislation that threatens individuals families and communities Most recently that included sending a letter to Texas leadership opposing laws that discriminate against the LGBTQ community Read more here,8
In the US the legal system is one avenue through which Apple can take action to support our values For example in January 2022 Apple along with other leading companies filed an amicus brief in support of the EPAs authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions because that authority is critical to combatting climate change,25
In November 2021 Apple filed a lawsuit against NSO Group and its parent company to hold it accountable for the surveillance and targeting of Apple users The complaint provides new information on how NSO Group infected victims devices with its Pegasus spyware To prevent further abuse and harm to its users Apple is seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software services or devices,1
Our commitment to human rights,10
Our commitment begins with treating everyone with dignity and respect But it doesnt end there We believe in the power of technology to empower and connect people around the world and that business can and should be a force for good,10
Embedding respect for human rights,10
Weve worked to embed respect for human rights across our company in the technology we make the way we make it and how we treat people A number of teams are responsible for carrying out human rights due diligence including the Privacy Corporate and Compliance teams within Apples Legal and Global Security organization as well as Apples Environment and Supply Chain Innovation ESCI team within Worldwide Operations,10
Our commitment to civil rights,10
We are deeply committed to building a more,10
just and inclusive world and are moving forward,8
with plans to conduct a civil rights audit,10
Our Human Rights Policy governs how we treat everyone including our customers employees business partners and people across our supply chain Were deeply committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights in our business operations as set out in the United Nations UN International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organizations ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work Our approach is based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights UNGPs,10
We conduct human rights due diligence to identify risks and work to mitigate them We also seek to remedy adverse impacts track and measure our progress and report our findings Our board of directors adopted the policy and is responsible for overseeing and periodically reviewing it Apples Senior Vice President and General Counsel is responsible for its implementation and reports to the Board and its committees on our progress and significant issues,10
Identifying and managing salient human rights risks,10
Identifying human rights risks is the first step to addressing those risks through improvements to our policies and management systems We work to align our efforts with the business and human rights due diligence process set forth in the UNGPs to identify mitigate prevent and remedy human rights risks,10
We identify salient human rights risks through internal risk assessments and external industry level thirdparty audits as well as through the channels we maintain with rights holders and other stakeholders including investors human rights and labor experts governments and international bodies such as the UN,10
In addition to our own internal monitoring we consider reports identifying potential risks from external sources including international organizations policy makers shareholders civil society organizations news outlets customers individuals in the supply chain or supply chain communities whistleblower mechanisms and thirdparty hotlines Reports also come through the reporting mechanisms we make available directly to all supplier employees Apple employees and the general public These reports can come to us in any language and can be anonymous,17
Based on this due diligence examples of human rights issues of particular focus at Apple include,10
Privacy freedom of expression and access,22
Discrimination risks in workforce management,8
and in product and services development,15
Labor and human rights risks in the,10
Were committed to continually assessing our progress and incorporating what we learn into our work We track and measure our performance across a range of areas and apply the lessons we learn to continually improve We publicly report detailed information on our approach and our performance in the reports websites and other disclosures listed on page8 as well as within this ESG Report,3

to protect the planet in how we design build and recycle our products and through responsible sourcing and use of materials and natural resources,15
The rainbow arches at Apple Park in Cupertino California are a nod to Apples original,23
logo and an expression of our inclusive values,8
At Apple were acting with urgency to protect our planets limited resources and to be a leader in the fight against climate change Since 2020 weve been carbon neutral for our worldwide operations and by 2030 we plan to expand that progress to our entire supply chain and the lifetime use of our products And today nearly 20 percent of the materials in our products were made from recycled content a number were working toincrease,15
Across our environmental work were also committed to being a force for equity Were working with communities on the frontlines of climate change and the next generation of diverse entrepreneurs to create shared opportunity and to build a more just world,13
The environmental challenges we face today are significant and were responding with urgency and dedication We approach our work by focusing on fundamental questions What matters most And where can we make the greatest impact These questions guide our work across our strategic focus areas of climate change resources and smarter chemistry and inform our goals in how we can best achieve change,13
Our 2022 Environmental Progress Report provides a detailed overview of our work and how were progressing toward our goals,10
We know were not alone in working to reduce our environmental footprint So were engaging with others to support our efforts and find opportunities to lift local communities along the way,10
Setting ambitious goals is essential to our approach to drive the innovation and collaboration that makes change possible and to be transparent and accountable to our progress,12
Our work is led by Lisa Jackson Apples Vice President of Environment Policy and Social Initiatives reporting directly to CEO Tim Cook The Environment Policy and Social Initiatives team works with other teams across Apple to set strategy engage stakeholders and communicate progress Our integrated approach means that decisions about the environment are reviewed and supported at the highest levels of the company,10
As a global business we believe it is our responsibility to take strong decisive and inclusive steps to mitigate our climate impact Weve committed to achieving carbon neutrality reducing emissions 75 percent compared with fiscal year 2015 and balancing the residual emissions with carbon removal across the life cycle of all of our products by 20301 And the Science Based Targets initiative SBTi has validated an emissions reduction target for Apple derived from this goal2 Its an ambitious plan with plenty of challenges ahead But were already well on our way having cut carbon emissions across our value chain by 40 percent since fiscal year 2015,25
Our work began years ago making the transition to sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity at our offices retail stores and data centers,24
which we achieved in 2018 And in 2020 we reached the milestone of being carbon neutral for our corporate operations including direct emissions as well as business travel and employee commute,25
Our 10year Climate Roadmap is addressing Apples carbon footprint through five pillars,13
Lowcarbon design We will design products and manufacturing processes to be less carbonintensive through thoughtful material selection increased material efficiency and greater product energy efficiency,15
Energy efficiency We will increase energy efficiency at our facilities and in our supply chain by finding opportunities such as retrofitting to reduce energy use,24
decrease in emissions across our entire value chain since 2015,25
renewable energy sourced for all Apple facilities,24
suppliers committed to 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple production,24
issued in green bonds to model how businesses can drive investments to reduce global emissions In our latest Green Bond Impact Report we share progress on the projects funded in fiscal year 2021,12
Renewable electricity We will continue to source 100 percent renewable electricity for our facilities and transition our entire supply chain to 100 percent clean renewable sources of electricity,24
Direct emissions abatement We will reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions in our facilities and our supply chain through process innovation emissions abatement and the use of nonfossilbased lowcarbon fuels,25
Carbon removal Working in parallel with our emissions reduction efforts we will scale up investments in carbon removal projects including naturebased solutions that protect and restore ecosystems around the world,23
To reduce the carbon footprint of our products were increasing efficiency and transitioning to materials from recycled sources and those made using lowcarbon energy In 2021 we continued to improve the carbon efficiency of the integrated circuits we use in our products components weve prioritized because they are carbonintensive For example switching to the Apple M1 chip for the 13inch MacBook Pro reduced the energy needed to manufacture and use the device driving down the products carbon footprint by over 8 percent,15
Weve continued to expand our use of 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosures of a number of products All iPad models in our lineup now use 100 percent recycled aluminum in their enclosures joining Apple Watch Series 7 Apple Watch SE MacBook Air Mac mini and the 14inch and 16inch MacBook Pro devices For products released in 2021 that had enclosures made with primary aluminum we,15
To minimize the carbon footprint of our products we seek to create less waste in the processing of materials reduce machining time and the associated energy used more efficiently transform material into the shapes we need and maximize recovery and reprocessing of manufacturing scrap,19
prioritized the use of aluminum smelted using lowcarbon sources of electricity rather than fossil fuels for a lower carbon impact These changes alone have decreased the carbon emissions associated with our use of aluminum by 68 percent since 2015,24
Product energy use accounts for 22 percent of our gross carbon footprint and has an impact on the individual energy use of each of our customers By addressing this in the earliest phases of design weve cut the product energy use across all major product lines by more than 70 percent since 2008 through energy efficiency improvements3 In fiscal year 2021 over 99 percent of Apples eligible products by revenue received an ENERGY STAR rating for superior energy efficiency4 And over 99 percent of Apples eligible products by revenue met the requirements for EPEAT registration5,24
Were focused on using less energy across our operations beginning with how we design operate and maintain our facilities And we continue these same efforts into our supply chain which benefits the communities where our suppliers operate Drawing less energy from electrical grids many of which still rely heavily on fossil fuels helps reduce local air pollution and improve air quality for nearby communities,21
The emissions from manufacturing our products account for about 70 percent of Apples gross carbon footprint We launched our Supplier Energy Efficiency Program in 2015 with the goal of helping suppliers optimize their facilities and operations to use as little energy as possible We provide guidance designed to help suppliers uncover opportunities for energy efficiency Suppliers in our Supplier Energy Efficiency Program avoided more than 1150000 annualized metric tons of supply chain carbon emissions in fiscal year 2021,24
This past year we intensified our efforts to reduce Apples emissions In fiscal year 2021 we avoided over 23 million metric tons of emissions across all scopes Initiatives that weve been growing for years like sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity for our facilities transitioning suppliers to clean energy and using lowcarbon materials in products yielded indisputable results,24
Thanks to this work weve begun to decouple business growth from emissions While our revenue grew 33 percent our emissions grew by less than 5 percent To mitigate this increase in emissions we applied an additional 06 million tons of renewable energy credits RECs and 05 million metric tons of carbon offsets to proportionally cover electricity use and direct emissions respectively across our value chain This represents a shortterm bridging solution as we grow our carbon reduction programs to meet the scale of the challenge,25
Emissions categories of gross emissions,25

Lowcarbon materials represents emissions savings from transitioning to recycled materials in our products or use of lowcarbon aluminum as described on page 18 Net carbon emissions represents our total gross footprint minus carbon offsets applied to each category Percentages shown for each emissions category represent the share of Apples gross footprint Totals add up to more than 100 percent due to rounding,25
Our retail stores data centers and offices around the world currently source 100 percent renewable electricity Weve focused our efforts to source renewables around several key pillars creating new renewable energy projects undertaking projects that deliver clear benefits to local communities and supporting renewable energy innovations About 15 gigawatts of Applecreated renewable electricity projects account for over 90 percent of the renewable electricity our facilities use,24
To address the nonelectricity emissions associated with our materials and manufacturing processes we seek technological solutions through emissions abatement or switching to lowcarbon fuel options For example we partnered with aluminum companies and the governments of Canada and Quebec to help fund research and development for ELYSIS a technology that eliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions from aluminum smelting,25
We continue to experience tremendous progress toward our goal of transitioning our manufacturing supply chain to 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030 As of March 2022 213 manufacturing partners in 25 countries have committed to 100 percent renewable energy for Apple production,24
Over 70 percent of companies on Apples Supplier List those suppliers that make up 98 percent of Apples direct spend for materials manufacturing and assembly of our products worldwide have committed to 100 percent renewable electricity In addition many other smaller suppliers have also made these commitments,15
Many components essential to products like ours including integrated circuit chips and display panels currently rely on manufacturing processes that use fluorinated gases which have high global warming potential Were partnering closely with key manufacturers to prevent these gases from being released into the atmosphere by optimizing manufacturing processes and deploying abatement technologies,25
To address emissions from shipping products to our customers were shifting whenever possible toward less carbonintensive shipping modes such as rail and ocean And were seeking out technical innovations including alternative fuels and electric vehicles In fiscal year 2021 Apple avoided 180000 metric tons of CO2e by shifting the mode of transport and reducing product weight through the removal of the power adapter from the box of iPhone devices,15
Providing access to clean energy in South Africa,24
Even a few years ago not everyone in one community in South Africa had electricity,12
at home Many people had been using batterypowered lanterns because upfront costs,24
and other challenges put connecting to the grid out of reach As we worked with our,24
partners to identify new renewable energy projects for our Power for Impact program,24
we saw exciting potential in this community,10
Our partner on the ground DC GO a solar energy provider based in Johannesburg,24
got to work meeting members of the community and learning more about their needs,10
Ultimately DC GO developed a payasyougo model that brought solar energy to 3500,24
homes that previously lacked access This was possible only because of the way they,2
built relationships with community members and worked with Apple to price the solution,10
in line with what people were already spending on batteries for their lanterns,24
In addition DC GO hired and trained local people for jobs in sales maintenance,8
and other roles that not only created local jobs but also helped to make sure the project,11
and the communitys access to electricity would be sustainable over time,24
This is just one example of how the Power for Impact program is working to benefit,12
communities our company and the environment at the same time Learn more,10

In 2020 we conducted a climate scenario analysis to help us better understand the potential physical and,13
transition effects of climate change To align with the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures,13
TCFD recommendations we considered a range of future scenarios including a scenario below 2C,13
And we assessed geographies around the world to capture both corporate and supplier activities The,17
analysis highlighted how our renewable energy program and carbon neutrality goals could contribute to our,12
corporate resiliency It also provided environmental data that we considered in developing business strategies,3
including considerations around supply chain diversification as well as safeguarding our global assets,17
Were committed to managing regulatory reputational and market risks related to climate change,13
For more information on these climaterelated risks and Apples governance of these risks read our,13
To address the emissions we cant yet avoid were are investing in carbon removal projects In addition to removing carbon naturebased carbon removal projects also offer important ecological and social benefits such as preserving biodiversity and enhancing the resilience of ecosystems while often providing economic development opportunities for local communities,23
We partnered with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs to launch the innovative Restore Fund which seeks to blend responsible forestry practices with carbon removal Were working with forestry managers to create sustainably managed forests that optimize for both carbon and wood production creating revenue from timber and generating high quality carbon credits Apple will invest up to 200 million in projects that aim to remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it all while meeting clear social and environmental impact criteria and offering a financial return In its pilot phase the Restore Fund has a goal of removing at least 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year,25
As the projects in the Restore Fund come online were also working to address difficult toavoid emissions in the short term In fiscal year 2021 167000 metric tons of carbon credits were retired from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal year 2021 And we purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total of 500000 metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain a REDD coastal conservation project in Guatemala and a reforestation project in Guizhou Province of China These projects are all certified to the VCS and CCB standards,25
For more information on our efforts to combat,10
climate change and reach our 2030 carbon neutral goal read our 2022 Environmental Progress Report,13
As the Restore Fund projects come online weve partnered with Conservation International to,23
develop and invest in naturebased carbon removal projects This includes a project to protect,25
and restore 27000 acres of mangrove forests in Colombia,23

Natural resources make our work possible and we take responsibility for how we source use and recycle the materials we rely on to create our products As a starting point this means sourcing responsibly minimizing our freshwater use and eliminating waste across our operations and those of our suppliers And were also seeking to redefine the overall resource footprint of our products Our goal is to one day make products using only responsibly sourced recycled and renewable materials,15
Within resources we focus on three main areas of impact,2
Materials Transitioning to only recycled or renewable materials in our products and packaging and maximizing material efficiency product longevity and recovery,15
Water Reducing water impacts in the,20
manufacturing of our products use of our services and operation of our facilities At the same time transitioning to alternative sources improving the quality of water we discharge and protecting shared water resources,20
Zero waste Minimizing overall waste,19
generated and eliminating waste sent to landfill from our manufacturing supply chain as well as corporate offices data centers and retail stores,19
We aim to make the best use of the materials we rely on to make our products Thats why were focusing on three different levers to reduce our footprint and achieve circularity sourcing and efficiency product longevity and product endoflife,15
Sourcing and efficiency Last year we made progress across materials from expanding our use of recycled rare earth elements to designing cameras with recycled gold In September we introduced iPhone 13 with more certified recycled materials than any previous version of iPhone We also introduced 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosures on every single model in the iPad lineup,15
In fiscal year 2021 nearly 20 percent of thematerial we shipped in products came from recycled and renewable sources,15
In fiscal year 2021 we more than doubled our use of recycled tungsten rare earth elements and cobalt and introduced certified recycled gold for the first time in an Apple product,15
Weve reduced the plastic in our packaging by 75 percent compared with 2015 progressing toward our goal to eliminate all plastic from our packaging by 2025,15
Across our business we released eight products with more than 20 percent recycled content6 The MacBook Air with M1 chip 2020 had the highest total made with 44 percent recycled content devicewide including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure These and other innovations helped us increase our use of recycled or renewable content to 18 percent of all the material shipped in products in fiscal year 20217,15
Product longevity We want to make the most of the materials we use through designing longlasting products We are designing durable hardware leveraging software updates to extend functionality expanding access to repair services refurbishing devices for their next user and reusing parts that still have more to give Read more on caring for customers on page 56,15
Product endoflife By effectively recovering the materials in our products we enable the circular supply chains that make the best use of finite resources Through our work in this area were reducing the need to mine new materials and the amount of energy needed to manufacture new products ultimately driving down emissions and conserving resources,15
In 99 percent of the countries where we sell products we continue to provide and participate in product takeback and recycling collection programs With the help of customer and employee participation across recycling programs we directed more than 38000 metric tons of ewaste to recycling globally in fiscal year 2021,15
Weve also continued to innovate on disassembly technologies Daisy the robot we designed to disassemble iPhone devices has now been joined by Dave which dismantles Taptic Engines from iPhone to enable the recovery of materials like rare earth elements tungsten and steel and Taz designed to recycle modules containing rare earth magnets At our Material Recovery Lab were working on developing better more efficient means of disassembling products that maximize material recovery while minimizing waste,19
Innovating packaging to reduce our footprint,15
Weve made significant progress toward eliminating all plastics from our packaging by 2025,15
This past year plastics accounted for only 4 percent of our packaging Since 2015 weve,15
dedicated our efforts to replacing large plastic trays wraps and foam cushioning with fiber,15
alternatives that have higher recovery rates and reduced environmental footprints,24
This year the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro were the first iPhone models to be shipped without any plastic packaging components8 And we replaced plastic foam with a fiber alternative to protect the 24inch iMac during shipping,15
For the 24inch iMac using corrugated fiber rather than foam for shock absorption,9
allowed us to reduce plastic by 72 percent,19
Were committed to managing the resources we share with the communities where we and our suppliers operate Our efforts to address the water footprint of our corporate sites and of our suppliers sites focus on,20
Expanding the use of alternative water,20
Enhancing our water stewardship to keep,20
watersheds healthy for all who rely on them,2
In fiscal year 2021 our facilities used about 14 billion gallons of water We saved 133 million gallons of freshwater this fiscal year due to efficiency projects implemented since 20179 Last year alternative water sources accounted for 10 percent of our total corporate water usage primarily from recycled water sources10,20
Our supply chain accounts for 99 percent of our total water footprint based on our detailed water inventory Thats why we partner closely with our suppliers through our Clean Water Program The more than 195 participating supplier sites increased their average reuse rate to 41 percent and saved our suppliers 123 billion gallons of freshwater in fiscal year 2021 for a total of 503 billion gallons of water savings since the programs launch in201311,20
Apple supplier facilities are zero waste verified,19

Apple works with the Alliance for Water Stewardship and others to promote water stewardship that protects,20
the health of water basins including the Kunshan watershed in China,20
Read more about our efforts to conserve resources in our 2022 Environmental Progress Report,23
Across our corporate operations were reducing the amount of waste we generate and directing more toward recycling programs In fiscal year 2021 recycling and composting efforts allowed us to achieve a waste diversion rate of 68 percent limiting landfill waste from our global operations to about 15000 metric tons12 Our overall waste generated also remained low in part due to COVIDrelated temporary closure of facilities Last year our Mesa Arizona data center became the second Apple facility to receive TRUE certification for zero waste following the Prineville data center in 202013,19
Weve partnered with our suppliers recyclers and waste solution providers to eliminate waste from our manufacturing processes At the close of fiscal year 2021 more than 100 facilities had been zero waste verified nearly half of the supplier facilities that are part of our Zero Waste Program14 All participating facilities across 12 countries can access resources including guidance on how to reduce waste and then reuse recycle or compost the waste they do create And were seeing results In fiscal year 2021 suppliers redirected 491000 metric tons of waste from landfills bringing the total to over 2 million metric tons since the programs inception the equivalent of eliminating more than 25 million square meters of landfill space,19
The wellbeing of our employees customers people in our supply chain and the planet is a priority for Apple which is why were committed to using safer materials to create safer products This commitment requires diligent work to build a comprehensive picture of chemicals across our supply chain to insist on rigorous chemical management processes to promote adoption of safer chemical alternatives and to innovate through design smarter approaches to making our products Using safer chemistry in our products also enables recycling and material recovery so that our products can be the raw materials for the next generation,15
The pillars of our smarter chemistry strategy are,18
Mapping and engagement Engage our supply chain partners to comprehensively identify the chemicals in the materials used to make our products allowing us to drive change that goes beyond what is required for regulatory compliance,15
Assessment and management Assess the potential human health and environmental risks of chemicals to evaluate compliance with our requirements and inform product design,15
Innovation Drive the development and use of innovative materials that enable the creation of groundbreaking products and also support industrywide change,15
Our Full Material Disclosure FMD program maps the chemicals used in our products an effort that includes tens of thousands of parts and assemblies Then we look at how our products are manufactured Our Chemical Safety Disclosure CSD program engages with supply chain partners to get the most recent information on which materials are in use This information includes the volume of materials being consumed and how theyre being applied stored and handled as well as the steps being taken to protect employees,14
More than 1000 supplier facilities have shared their chemical inventories as well as storage and safety protocols as part of our CSD program Through this process weve identified more than 17000 chemicals and applications These efforts contribute to a safer work environment for people across our supply chain,14
The data we collect on chemicals and materials forms the foundation for key decisions that have an impact on our product designs manufacturing processes and approach to recycling and reuse This data enables us to establish requirements for our suppliers including those set out in our Regulated Substances Specification RSS and the Restricted Chemicals for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials list These requirements provide clear guidelines on potentially harmful materials including those that are restricted,15
Our assessment system helps to ensure that only materials that meet our stringent requirements are used in Apple products Atour Environmental Testing Lab we evaluate the safety of our products and materials through chemical analyses Our chemists test materials for safety and monitor compliance with our specifications In fiscal year 2021 we performed toxicological assessments on 1000 new materials to proactively evaluate and eliminate potentially harmful substances from our products,14
Both the data we gather on chemicals and our rigorous assessments allow us to make informed decisions and manage chemicals forthe safety of those who use make and recycle our products,14
The work we do in mapping assessing and managing the chemicals within our supply chain underpins our innovations We rely on detailed information on the material properties including toxicological data and environmental performance characteristics We also look,19

at how these materials are used at each point in the product life cycle from design to manufacturing to endoflife This allows us to seek out and support the development of safer chemistries that have an impact on each phase and contribute to continually improving the overall safety of our products and processes,15
Since the late 1990s we have diligently identified and removed potentially harmful chemicals from our products such as brominated flame retardants beryllium mercury and lead Were also driving the use of safer process chemicals in our supply chain Since 2018 all our final assembly sites have used only safer alternative cleaners and degreasers As we work toward minimizing potentially harmful chemistries in our products and processes were making the transition to safer alternatives accessible to others through industry initiatives partnerships and standards with the hope of driving chemical safety across the industry,14

Apples voluntary decision review enables employees to have an employment decision reevaluated This is designed to promote fairness and impartiality in line with our values and policies The reviewer will consider any new information that indicates the decision may not have been in accordance with our policies and guidelines,12
In addition to our fulltime employees temporary workers and vendor services play an important role on our team Our temporary workers generally perform similar work as our fulltime employees as they are intended to augment the Apple employee workforce under a short to midterm assignment Approximately,11
6 percent of our US corporate workforce were temporary workers as of October 2021 Temporary workers have the same opportunity to be considered as all other applicants to any Apple job posting whether that opportunity is a conversion of their current role or a role they found on our job site And in our retail business we have a strong record of hiring temporary workers as full and parttime employees,11
Our outsourced services with workers provided via vendors generally perform work that can be different from that performed by our permanent employees This workforce is intended to support business needs where specific skills are required and the vendors have the ability to scale with our varied business needs,11
Pay and benefits For vendor services pay rates are managed by the vendor Various benefits including but not limited to healthcare are offered to these workers through their employer or staffing agencies Vendors are also accountable to Apples Supplier Code of Conduct which requires that our staffing agencies are compliant with all current local and national legislation and employment laws including wage and benefits requirements for their employees see page 37 or People and Environment in Our Supply Chain,11
Raising concerns In many cases there are multiple avenues for nonApple workers to report problems anonymously including internal processes with their employer and the Apple Business Conduct Helpline see page 72,11
Performance Vendor performance is reviewed and evaluated by the vendor management based on feedback sometimes received from Apple managers Procurement andor Supplier Responsibility,17
At every stage of the pandemic our first priority has always been the health of our teams customers and communities That meant being one of the first companies to close our offices and retail stores and finding innovative ways to connect with colleagues and customers virtually,6
Since 2020 weve continued our efforts and programs to support our people We adopted CDC recommendations around uptodate vaccinations including booster doses Apple also continued to pay our teams during temporary store and office closures expanded our paid leave policies and enhanced our policies and procedures for a safe work environment both in the office and instore,9
To keep our teams informed we deployed comprehensive resources with uptodate COVID19 information including a dedicated platform for teams returning to the office COVID19 case support implemented for all team members included returntowork guidance and contact tracing with the utmost regard for employee privacy We continue to offer special sick leave for employees with possible COVID19 symptoms as well as comprehensive health coverage,9
To continue to manage our response going forward we created a dedicated pandemic response team in 2022 in addition to the crossfunctional team that has been supporting and guiding our COVID response The new response team will support future pandemic planning and response,5
The health of our teams customers and communities continues to be our first priority,10
Innovating to support our customers,15
Despite all of the pandemics challenges we brought our hardware software and services into customers hands helping them stay informed connected and entertained,18
We also tailored our services to promote easy access to trusted information on COVID19 launching a dedicated section on Apple News prioritizing visibility of essential services locations including COVID19 testing and vaccination locations on Apple Maps offering a curated collection of telehealth apps on the App Store and leveraging Siri to provide the latest COVID19 guidance,2
To meet the extraordinary challenges of virtual education we delivered new content and services for students parents and teachers to foster creativity and learning in a digital environment We worked with mobile carriers and school administrators to deliver iPad devices with cellular support for students in need With our Apple Card Customer Assistance Program we also offered customers the option to skip their monthly payments without incurring interest,2
Across many of our Apple Store locations we were able to serve our customers needs through contactless pickup express storefronts and new online support Our response to COVID19 is still ongoing and were committed to implementing health protocols and adjusting store operations as required based on available data and guidance from health officials,2
Supporting people in our supply chain,17
We are continuing to work together with our suppliers to help them ensure that every necessary precaution is taken to keep people safe at work In 2020 we introduced an enhancement to our Code and Standards specifically addressing Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response IDPR IDPR contains a set of new requirements resulting from our learnings during the pandemic which will help our suppliers better prepare for and be ready to respond to an infectious disease outbreak at their facility As part of the rollout of IDPR in fiscal year 2021 we conducted more than 200 onsite and remote specialized assessments to verify suppliers compliance with COVID19 control protocols in order to drive improvement when necessary,5
We also continue to assess any existing gaps at supplier facilities and identify opportunities to work with those in higherrisk areas to help make their facilities safer This includes working with thirdparty suppliers to redesign and reconfigure factory floor plans where necessary implementing flexible working hours to maximize interpersonal space implementing enhanced deep cleaning protocols and deploying masks and sanitizers In fiscal year 2021 we also encouraged our suppliers employees to get vaccinated and boosted where available,9
We also partnered with NGOs to help further support supplier employees as well as those working deeper in our supply chain particularly those from vulnerable groups We worked with the International Organization for Migration IOM the worlds leading organization providing services to migrant workers to provide support to migrant workers impacted,11
by the pandemic With support from Apple our longtime partner Pact an international development organization prepared and coordinated activities to prevent the spread of COVID19 in several mining communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC The initiative has reached more than 50000 people through individual and group dialogues on COVID19 prevention since the program began in December 2020,5
Giving back to our communities,10
Apples companywide response to the COVID19 pandemic involved teams across the business including product design engineering operations packaging teams suppliers and more At the beginning of the pandemic when personal protective equipment was in short supply we sourced through our supply chain and donated more than 30 million masks for healthcare workers worldwide We also launched a companywide effort to produce and ship over 10 million face shields These face shields were delivered to sites around the world from New York Presbyterian Hospital in the US to the Ministry of Health in Zambia,9
Additionally we have also donated over 10 million to the World Health Organizations COVID19 Solidarity Response Fund We also matched employee donations twotoone to support COVID19 response efforts worldwide We awarded 10 million from our Advanced Manufacturing Fund to COPAN diagnostics a market leader in sample collection kits that rapidly accelerated their ability to supply sample collection kits to hospitals in the US for COVID19 testing And our partnership with Product RED also supported COVID19 response see page 65,6
In partnership with the White House Coronavirus Task Force and the CDC we released an app and a website that guided Americans through a series of questions about their health and exposure to determine if they should seek care for COVID19 symptoms providing CDC recommendations on next steps including guidance on social distancing and selfisolating how to closely monitor,9
symptoms recommendations on testing and when to contact a medical provider And we collaborated with Google to create a new exposure notification system for global governments and health agencies with user privacy and security central to its design to help fight the pandemic,1
Collaboration with our suppliers helps them make sure theyre taking every necessary,17
precaution to keep people safe at work,9
Health and safety at Apple,9
Were dedicated to protecting our team members and our customers everywhere we operate a responsibility COVID19 has brought into even greater focus At every stage of the pandemic weve made decisions based on the latest local data and public health guidance and we share lessons across our Environment Health and Safety EHS teams globally so we can continuously improve our safety programs,9
Were always working hard to make sure our workers are safe no matter where they are when theyre conducting business for Apple We abide by EHS requirements in every country where we operate and are dedicated to doing everything we can to support the safety and wellbeing of our global teams,9
Managing workrelated hazards and risks To help ensure the safety of our workers and customers we put procedures in place to identify workplace risks and mitigate possible hazards We support and protect employees in lower hazard spaces and we put risk specific programs in place for those working in higher hazard environments including safe systems of work chemical management laser safety equipment and machinery safety hazardous materials management and electrical safety Employees can request to have their workspaces individually inspected to review hazards and controls including ergonomics evaluations,9
Apple implements a hierarchy of control for significant risks which centers on elimination substitution engineering controls administrative controls and personal protective equipment PPE,5
As one example Apple EHS regularly assesses hazards at our research labs based on their chemical equipment laser and other hazards Approximately 9 percent of our labs are considered complex meaning that they contain highhazard processes and equipment These assessments help teams understand which EHS programs and controls must be put in place to mitigate risks In 2021 Apple completed hazard assessments in over 2500 research labs globally,9
Our EHS teams identify and provide team members with appropriate PPE for specific hazards This PPE is provided at no cost and with training on correct use For example our hearing conservation programs include evaluation and control of occupational exposures to noise and hearing protection is available for processes areas and tasks with potential high noise exposures Additionally EHS conducts mandatory health checks for employees where theyre needed,9
We invest in new technologies as we continue to manage potential risks across our operations including our Appleowned manufacturing sites Our standards programs trainings procedures and other safeguards are managed by trained EHS professionals and where required we also translate EHS procedures into local languages for our team members,12
Risks identified from incidents injuries and nonroutine events are addressed expeditiously to identify and implement appropriate corrective and preventative actions and we integrate our learnings into future program development and training Lessons learned are routinely communicated across Apples EHS team and potentially affected operations and they are used to inform updates to existing policies and procedures,9
Employees and managers can report incidents nearmisses and observations including newly identified hazards and risksthrough an internal iOS app Incident responses are addressed by Apples EHS team through a consistent process that connects employees with care and support while identifying corrective actions where appropriate to prevent future occurrences,5
Waste management Apple is committed to minimizing resource use and the associated generation of non hazardous or hazardous waste Where possible Apple implements a waste hierarchy of prevention waste reduction at the source reuse of materials recycling energy recovery and landfilling as a last resort,19
We maintain our commitment to the safe and responsible management of hazardous waste both onsite and offsite Any facility that does not meet our requirements is replaced by another approved waste management facility,19
We made progress in 2021 at sites around the world,2
US Thirteen of the Treatment Storage and Disposal Facilities TSDFs we utilize in the US were audited in 2021 to confirm that the waste is treated recycled or incinerated within the governing safety standards for health and the environment Eight disposal facility reviews were completed by vendors under Apple management and we reviewed five other sites via thirdparty audit reports At one of our major research labs in Santa Clara Valley the empty container management program resulted in a 3 percent reduction of lab debris for hazardous waste streams,19
United Kingdom Through an internal initiative to further strengthen waste management product sitespecific waste initiatives achieved a 97 percent diversion from landfill and a 04 tonnes of waste1002 both exceeding requirements,19
Ireland The Cork Campus is ECVP 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill Certified annually and has had no material landfilled in the past five years,19
Ergonomics In 2021 we continued to support our global team members working from home office Apple office and nonoffice settings,3
The Apple ergonomics program is heavily focused on preventative measures to reduce the risk of workrelated musculoskeletal disorders WMSDs This includes ergonomics training sessions for our team members and providing input into the purchase or design of work equipment systems and facilities to ensure that they meet ergonomic standards to provide the best levels of efficiency comfort health and safety for anyone using them Our,9
ergonomics trainings and selfassessment support are aimed at creating an awareness of ergonomic risk factors for WMSDs how to prevent them and how to proactively request for adjustments to workstations,18
We completed over 10000 individual support requests for our team members working from home along with those who returned to Apple offices and Apple Store locations Support included tailored guidance and feedback equipment recommendations and 11 virtual or inperson assessments In addition over 3000 employees participated in various training sessions,8
Our industrial warehouse and other non office operations teams were supported with approximately 400 ergonomic risk assessments and 76 lab screenings The assessments evaluated risk factors such as repetition force posture and duration while reviewing the interaction of the team member with new machines equipment work processes and workspaces,17
Emergency preparedness and response Beyond COVID19 we supported the response to dozens of crisis events in 2021 including fires severe weather and civil unrest Our responses focused on the safety of our employees and business continuity We activated 31 crisis management teams CMTs to manage the most severe events and 120 additional incidents were supported without full CMTs,5
All team members can sign up for Apples Emergency Alert system enabling them to be notified of local emergencies and to indicate whether they are safe or need help Disaster supplies are available at our facilities All Apple campuses with over 1000 employees have Facility Response and Recovery Plans which provide a comprehensive approach to the safety and support of our employees while minimizing business interruption Sitespecific Emergency Response Plans have been implemented globally These plans are communicated to all employees and trainings and drills are held at least annually And our employees are trained in emergency response allowing them to react quickly while supporting the safety of our team members and customers,5
In 2021 we completed over 200 emergency response drills which were supported by 2700 trained Emergency Response Team ERT members We expect to increase the frequency of these drills depending on COVID19 restrictions,5
With the care and support of our employees and customers in mind we deployed Automatic External Defibrillator AED stations across our global retail stores in 2021 And to ensure that our team members could effectively use this new tool we provided AED training for our team members,9
All campuses and key sites have disaster supplies to match localized risks As Apples footprint grows sites are evaluated and supplies are added as needed As one example in 2021 we launched earthquake preparedness campaigns for employees across the western United States and Japan We conducted outreach to provide employees with information tools and resources and we held drills in some offices,5
Were always working hard to make sure our workers are safe no matter where they are when,9
theyre conducting business for Apple,3
Our EHS management systems are designed to provide a safe environment for teams,9
To provide a safe and sustainable environment for our teams our EHS programs are built to share information about risks requirements and expectations for all workers,9
Our EHS policy outlines our commitment to workplace safety and environmental stewardship and it establishes the principles that integrate effective EHS practices into all aspects of our business The EHS policy is communicated through mandatory training for all new employees and through our internal EHS website,9
Apples EHS leadership team including Apples EHS director is responsible for establishing priorities determining annual work plans and assigning resources to implement highquality services in all geographies where we operate,0
Certifications Our operations in Cork Ireland are certified to ISO14001 an international standard for environmental management systems And Apples Taiwan Technology Center is certified to ISO45001 for occupational health and safety management systems and working toward ISO14001 certifications in 2022,9
Inspections Our EHS inspections serve to both identify potential safety hazards and ensure that were following our internal processes to mitigate them To support this work Apple formalized our existing inspections program by launching enterprisewide software which allows users to create mobile inspections and then carry out inspections and safety compliance audits The tool also captures observations findings and corrective actions,9
Our inspections tool was deployed globally to 1050 users across various retail and corporate locations including Apple Store locations general office spaces RD labs kitchens and cafs data centers construction sites and laser labs,6
Training In 2021 Apple employees completed 68249 hours of safety training Apple currently offers 304 safety courses or trainings to our employees,9
Values that lead the way,10
Labor and human rights in the supply chain 40,11
People are at the center of everything we do and every decision we make While the pandemic has changed some of the ways we do our work our values remain the same The partnerships we have cultivated over the years throughout our supply chain have allowed us to continue to make significant progress in upholding the highest standards of labor and human rights and worker health and safety and make unprecedented achievements in climate action and the stewardship of natural resources Yet as proud as we are of our progress we know each year and each achievement is just a stepping stone in our continuous pursuit of better,9
Our commitment to people and the planet extends across our supply chain from manufacturing to services and to the many places where our suppliers operate We work closely with our suppliers to uphold the highest standards so that the people in our supply chain are safe and treated with respect and the environment is protected everywhere that Apple products are made,17
Apples work in this space is led by Apple senior management Sabih Khan is Apples Senior Vice President of Operations reporting to COO Jeff Williams Sabih is in charge of Apples global supply chain product quality and overseeing planning procurement manufacturing logistics and product fulfillment functions the programs that support Apples Environment and Supply Chain Innovation work,17
The Operations team also supports Apples environmental initiatives by partnering with suppliers to propel green manufacturing help conserve resources and protect the planet,23
Holding ourselves and our suppliers to the highest standards,17
As described on page 10 our Human Rights Policy outlines how we treat everyone including our customers employees business partners and people at every level of our supply chain We take a very broad view of our supply chain see diagram on page 38 and the responsibility that comes with it We consider our supply chain to include everything that goes into designing building delivering supporting and recycling of Apple products aswell as our retail stores and all of the services and operations that are part of our supply chain ecosystem,17
The Apple Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards outline our requirements for our suppliers in the areas of labor and human rights health and safety environment ethics and management systems Since 2005 the Code and Standards have been updated annually are published on our website in 15 languages and communicated to our suppliers,17
The requirements in our Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards and the due diligence we conduct across our supply chain align with internationally recognized labor and human rights standards including those of the International Labour Organization ILO the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights UNGPs the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD as well as industryleading health and safety organizations,17

2021 Efforts to Combat Human,9
A global network of people and businesses working together to build the best products in the world,15
Our People and Environment in Our Supply Chain Report page 99 provides a detailed overview of progress in our supply chain including efforts to identify mitigate prevent and remedy human rights risks as outlined by the Business and Human Rights Due Diligence process set forth in the UNGPs,17
We work closely with many experts across Apple from product and services designers to facility managers to evaluate and update our Code and Standards annually to address emerging risks incorporate new legal requirements and industry best practices and reflect the needs of supplier employees in a dynamic operating environment We engage,17
with a range of stakeholders including rights holders civil society organizations academic experts and program partners to ensure that our Code and Standards reflect current internationally recognized labor human rights health and safety and environmental standards,11
in the procurement and product development cycles Since fiscal year 2020 9 percent of prospective suppliers evaluated for Code related risks have been prevented from entering our supply chain for being unable or unwilling to meet our Code and Standards,17
Upholding our values from the start,10
We work across our business to implement our standards from the earliest stages of product design and development from the suppliers we choose to work with to the materials in our products to the processes and equipment we use to make them We take a comprehensive approach to identifying and mitigating risks early,15
Once new suppliers are awarded Apple business we begin the process of helping them quickly get up to speed on our requirements through our supplier onboarding process In 2021 we expanded our onboarding process to engage new suppliers at an even earlier stage in their working relationship with Apple,17
We also extend our support to help prospective suppliers correct compliance issues found during the procurement process even when the supplier is not awarded Apples business at no cost to the participating companies Since 2020 68 percent of companies that were not awarded Apple business elected to join this voluntary program helping to protect people and the planet beyond the reach of our business and supply chain,17
We take a broad comprehensive approach to engaging with our suppliers to confirm that our standards are met One of the tools that we employ are assessments Assessments also known as audits are one of several methods we use to measure compliance with our requirements These independent thirdparty assessments which take place onsite at supplier facilities provide a snapshot of a suppliers performance However when combined with regular engagement with supplier teams mandated reporting and listening directly to hundreds of thousands of supplier employees about their workplace experiences our rigorous supplier assessments provide a clear measure of their performance in upholding our Code and Standards,17
In the 2021 reporting period 1177 assessments were conducted in 52 countries This included 886 Code of Conduct assessments and 291 smelter and refiner assessments20 Since 2007 Applemanaged assessments have covered 94 percent of our direct manufacturing spend,24
A responsibility that grows with our business,10
As Apples business continues to grow and expand to new areas we adapt our supplier engagement model accordingly This includes continuing to expand our scope to conduct independent thirdparty assessments of a growing number of suppliers that support our business outside of manufacturing Last year we increased our engagement and expanded the application of our Code and Standards to suppliers supporting newer areas of Apples business including those that work with our content services like Apple TV and AppleFitness,17
How we stay engaged with suppliers,17
been taken to prevent a reoccurrence We prohibit retaliation of any kind against supplier employees who participate in our assessments,0
Our goal is to work together with suppliers to help them improve their management systems rather than to simply remove them from our supply chain without helping them correct the issues we have discovered In the event that a supplier is unwilling or unable to improve their operations to meet our requirements they risk removal from our supply chain Since 2009 we have directed the removal of 24 manufacturing supplier facilities and 170 smelters and refiners from our supply chain for being unwilling or unable to sufficiently improve their operations to meet our requirements,17
Results of our assessments are detailed in our People and Environment in Our Supply Chain Report beginning on page 91,17
These assessments also include unannounced assessments and unannounced visits in response to workers grievances and allegations or to verify risks at supplier facilities based on predictive analytics In fiscal year 2021 211 unannounced assessments and investigations were conducted where the supplier facility was provided no advance notice of our arrival This is nearly double the number conducted in 2020,11
In addition to thirdparty Code of Conduct assessments we require many of our suppliers to also undergo the Responsible Business Alliances RBA Validated Assessment Program VAP a facilitywide thirdparty assessment,17
widely used by the industry A total of 99 RBA VAP assessments were completed in fiscal year 2021 at Apple supplier sites,17
If we uncover noncompliance in the course of any assessment or engagement we take prompt action so that suppliers not only correct and remedy the issue but make meaningful longterm changes to their systems and processes We do this through a Corrective Action Plan CAP during which 30 60 and 90day checkins with Apple are required We then conduct our Corrective Action Verification CAV process to verify that all corrective actions have been successfully implemented and necessary steps have,12
Supplier employees at Final Assembly in the US,17
We are collaborating with industry associations civil society organizations and multi stakeholder initiatives around the world to promote best practices to listen to and learn from others perspectives and experiences and to scale innovative solutions helping everyone to achieve progress at a more rapid pace See page 32 of the People and Environment in Our Supply Chain Report for more detail on the organizations we work with,17
Labor and human rights in the supply chain,11
People come first in everything we do Our commitment to protecting the people in our supply chain has been unwavering anchored by a simple set of beliefs People deserve to be treated with dignity and to know their rights They should be able to speak up if those rights are not being respected and to know and expect that when they do we will listen and act,10
Were committed to respecting the rights of every individual in our supply chain,17
We are committed to respecting the rights of every individual in our supply chain just like we do for our team members customers and other partners and more broadly to working with others to share our tools and the lessons weve learned and to empowering everyone to achieve progress more rapidly,17
Effective grievance channels ongoing worker management communications and supplier employee feedback are essential to ensuring respect for worker rights and maintaining safe and healthy workplaces Whether through social dialogue and formal employee representation workplace satisfaction surveys anonymous hotlines focus groups or interviews during annual assessments the feedback we receive directly from supplier employees helps us ensure labor and human rights are respected throughout our global supply chain We also use this feedback to address emerging risks improve rights training for supplier employees and supplier management and to continually strengthen our Code and Standards,11
Rights awareness We believe that,10
protection starts with rights awareness and since 2008 more than 236 million supplier employees have been trained on their workplace rights Under our Code and Standards suppliers are required to provide employees with training on their workplace rights This training is generally conducted during new employee orientation and covers international labor standards local labor laws environmental health and safety and the protections required by our Code and Standards,11
Feedback channels Supplier employee interviews are an important part of every assessment conducted Each year we interview tens of thousands of supplier employees in their local language and without their managers present to determine whether or not their experience on the job aligns with auditors observations during assessments In fiscal year 2021 despite the ongoing challenges presented by the COVID19 pandemic we interviewed 87626 workers in our supply chain over 35000 more than were interviewed in the previous fiscal year,17
Our Code and Standards require effective,12
worker feedback channels including grievance mechanisms at all supplier sites We also provide thirdparty anonymous hotlines which are also available to our employees see page 72 and the ability to contact the Apple Environment and Supply Chain Innovation ESCI team directly at any time and in any language When an issue is raised we require supplier management to immediately investigate and to resolve the issue in a timely manner,17
In 2021 we launched a grievance hotline awareness campaign and its initial rollout resulted in a 22 percent increase in utilization of these thirdparty hotlines The reports we received from supplier employees via hotlines in 2021 included issues related to wages and benefits employee relations amenities at supplier facilities workforce stability and health and safety In each case we investigated and worked directly with the suppliers to drive improvement and correct any compliance issues found Suppliers implemented a number of actions as a result of supplier employee feedback through these,9
supplier employees trained on their rights since 2008,11
supplier employees directly engaged about their workplace experiences through interviews and satisfaction surveys,8
supplier employees reached by grievance hotline awareness campaign,11
channels including improvements to working hours resignation processes timing of bonuses and the use of personal protective equipment PPE,11
Workplace satisfaction In addition to interviews and grievance channels we also engage with supplier employees to understand their overall workplace satisfaction In 2021 we anonymously surveyed 264963 supplier employees in 191 facilities across Greater China India Ireland Malaysia Philippines Singapore UK US and Vietnam about their workplace experiences nearly double the number of supplier employees surveyed last fiscal year As a result suppliers took 3944 actions including better commute options increasing wages and bonuses offering better food variety and skill development opportunities for entrylevel managers,11
Our Code and Standards and the protections they provide apply equally to all workers regardless of a persons job geographic location or how they enter our supply chain and this commitment begins even before a worker ever enters our supply chain This includes zero tolerance for forced labor,11
We implement strict policies and procedures with our suppliers to protect workers in our supply chain from forced labor This includes selecting suppliers for assessments based on factors such as their geographic location which may put them at higher risk of forced labor violations as well as their previous performance andor history of violations or allegations Suppliers may also receive additional specialized assessments based on the nature of their business or employee population such as those that employ Foreign Contract Workers and those located in higher risk migration corridors Our Code and Standards also require that all supplier employees have an effective mechanism to report grievances In addition we provide thirdparty anonymous hotlines and the ability to contact the Apple Environment and Supply Chain Innovation ESCI team directly at any time and in any language When an issue is raised supplier management is required to promptly investigate and to resolve the issue in a timely manner,11
We strictly prohibit any form of involuntary labor throughout our worldwide supply chain and look for evidence of it in every supplier assessment we conduct including unannounced assessments Last year we conducted more than 1100 assessments and found no instances where anyone was forced to work in our supply chain,11
We did discover two cases in Taiwan in which people paid recruitment fees to secure their job which is a violation of our Code We required the supplier to directly repay their employees in full and verified repayment through a thirdparty auditor The payment of recruitment fees withholding an employees passport or personal identity documents or restricting an employees freedom of movement are Core Violations of our Code and Standards the most serious level of Code violations If we discover workers have paid recruitment fees at any point on their employment journey to an Apple supplier we require supplier management to take prompt action to provide remedy to those affected by directly repaying their workers for any and all fees even if the supplier was unaware that their employees had paid recruitment fees From 2008 through fiscal year 2021 our suppliers have repaid 332 million in recruitment fees directly to 37322 workers,11
Finally in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration IOM and the Responsible Business Alliance RBA we expanded our Responsible Labor Recruitment Toolkit to more than 39 additional supplier facilities in 10 countries reaching nearly 77000 workers globally with 66 percent of those working on Apple production lines,11
How we work to prevent forced labor in our supply chain,11
Apple has zero tolerance for forced labor In the more than 50 countries and regions where our suppliers operate we have teams of experts including independent third parties who monitor our suppliers and put in place industryleading procedures to help ensure that no one is forced to work Our comprehensive policies start before we even sign a contract with suppliers and we are consistently raising the bar,11
1 We set the highest standards,14
3 We hold suppliers accountable,17
Eliminating forced labor begins with setting and maintaining the highest standards Our standards often go above and beyond legal requirements to protect people from forced labor risks,11
To address forced labor risks at its roots we know that our work has to begin before people enter our supply chain,11
Once weve implemented thorough preventative measures independent thirdparty assessments verify that our suppliers are meeting our standards Looking for evidence of forced labor is part of every supplier assessment If we find any violations of our Code and Standards we take swift action to remedy the issue and improve their operations,11
Thorough mapping informs our strategy,3
Apple policies and our supplier requirements align with international labor and human rights standards including those of the International Labour Organization the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights UNGPs and the Organisation for Economic CoOperation and Development,11
The Apple Human Rights Policy,10
Our Human Rights Policy outlines how we treat everyone including our customers employees business partners and the people across every level of our supply chain,17
Read the Apple Human Rights Policy,10
The Apple Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards Our supplier requirements contain strict standards for responsible labor recruitment and apply to all suppliers protecting workers globally We go above and beyond legal requirements in many places by strictly prohibiting labor recruitment in regions where we cannot conduct adequate due diligence and by maintaining a zero recruitment fees policy because we believe no one should pay to secure a job,11
Read the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards,17
An effective strategy requires deep understanding of our supply chain To date we have mapped over 1000 labor recruitment agencies that work with our suppliers across 32countries,17
A leading strategy requires leading tools,3
The Apple Responsible Labor Recruitment Toolkit developed in partnership with the International Organization for Migration provides suppliers and their labor agencies with easytouse tools that help them effectively manage and report data mitigating forced labor risks before people even enter our supply chain In addition to providing handson training we are making these tools openly available for others to use,11
We require our suppliers to provide their employees with training on their workplace rights on their first day on the job This helps to ensure that every person is aware of their rights and what to do if theyre not being respected which includes the ability to anonymously contact Apple directly Foreign Contract Workers who make up a very small percentage of people in our supply chain also receive training prior to leaving their home country as well as upon arriving in their destination country To date our suppliers have provided workplace rights training to over 236 million people In addition last year we directly engaged with over 350000 people in our supply chain to learn more about their workplace experience,11
Investing in consistent improvement Through our new Supplier Employee Development Fund were investing 50M to expand programs designed to continue to improve the rights training experience worker voice platforms and supplier employee education opportunities,11
We regularly conduct independent thirdparty assessments including surprise assessments of our suppliers verifying compliance with over 500 points across our standards This includes an extensive document review to be sure all hiring and personnel records are in place and accurate In addition to specialized forced labor assessments for atrisk suppliers we also require many suppliers to participate in facilitywide assessments such as the Validated Assessment Program to verify performance across the suppliers entire business In the event that we find gaps in a suppliers compliance or capabilities we require them to implement a Corrective Action Plan To date our assessments have covered 94 percent of our direct manufacturing spend,11
In addition to thoroughly assessing our suppliers performance in upholding our standards we also receive reports from the press governments civil society and people in our supply chain and we encourage the public to report concerns via httpswwwapplecomuksupplierresponsibility We investigate every report and frequently have Apple teams onsite within 24 hours,17
Swift action and steep penalties,12
Forced labor in any form is a Core Violation the most serious violation level of our requirements If a Core Violation is discovered the suppliers CEO is notified and the supplier is immediately placed on probation pending the successful completion of a Corrective Action Plan Probation can include no new projects no new business and termination of existing business In addition to commercial penalties if a supplier is unable or unwilling to meet our standards they risk removal from our supply chain Since 2009 we have directed the removal of 24 manufacturing supplier facilities and 170 smelters and refiners for failure to meet our requirements,11
In FY21 across more than 1100 assessments we found no instances where anyone was forced to work in our supply chain We did find two cases where employees of the same supplier in Taiwan paid recruitment fees Per our requirements the supplier directly repaid their employees for those fees To date our suppliers have directly repaid 332M in recruitment fees to 37322 of their employees,11
We track progress and report transparently,0

Building a culture of safety,9
Among many topics our Code and Standards cover the safe handling of chemicals emergency preparedness health and safety permits living and working conditions and incident management Health and safety is also an important part of every assessment we conduct Any instances of noncompliance with our Code and Standards during an assessment are addressed through customized Corrective Action Plans online training materials and capability building with EHS experts in order to improve their future performance In 2021 we began development of a safety culture guide to help suppliers cultivate a deeper more sustainable culture of safety in their facilities,9
Beyond keeping people in our supply chain safe were committed to creating workplaces where people can thrive This means giving our supplier employees the tools and resources to improve their physical and mental health and wellbeing,9
Since 2017 weve helped make health education and resources available to more than 295 million supplier employees on topics such,2
as reproductive health disease prevention and nutrition In 2021 we conducted a needs assessment to give supplier employees an opportunity to share their feedback and we are updating our resources with those results in mind,9
Safeguarding health through safer chemistry,9
Our commitment starts with setting and upholding strict material safety standards that often go beyond regulatory requirements in order to protect human health and the environment These are outlined in our Code and Standards and our Regulated Substances Specification RSS and are derived from international laws or directives regulatory agencies ecolabel requirements and environmental standards We then go further by intentionally designing our products and manufacturing processes to use safer materials as well as verifying that the correct health and safety protocols are being used across our supply chain And were making an impact beyond our supply chain by working with others to help make the use of safer materials the industry norm,14

Using our purchasing power for good,4
For Apple our work to make our company more inclusive extends to how we choose the businesses we work with When contracting with suppliers we use our purchasing power to increase diversity in our supply chain and change outdated norms that hurt those who are underrepresented in their field or industry,17
Apples awardwinning Supplier Diversity program established in 1993 actively engages suppliers from historically underrepresented communities,8
We have policies and procedures that require diverse supplier participation during earlystage sourcing key performance indicators to measure company success and diversity awareness trainings for our global sourcing team members and related Apple business units,17
In 2016 Apple was the first Silicon Valleybased company to be invited into the Billion Dollar Roundtable BDR in recognition of our longstanding commitment to promoting diversity within our supplier base BDR celebrates corporations that achieved spending of at least 1 billion with minority and womanowned businesses,8
In calendar year 2021 Apple spent over 71 billion with diverse suppliers around the world Our Supplier Diversity program offers support to participating suppliers and seeks active engagement in industry diversity leadership activities For example supplier development has been a longstanding commitment within Apples supply chain which is facilitated internally and externally Externally we partner with major universities to provide executive development and capacity building to key diverse suppliers And were proud to have supported Michigan State University and Howard University on creating their first programs for diverse supplier development,17
A highlight of 2021 was that for the first time we engaged diverse suppliers in North America in manufacturing accessories for some of Apples most well known products,15
Were also promoting diversity in the companies with which we do business For example our agreements with our primary construction suppliers require the reporting of their efforts to include diverse subcontractors on all Apple relatedprojects,17
As a result of our efforts we were chosen as Corporation of the Year by the National Minority Supplier Development Council NMSDC in October 2021 This award is NMSDCs highest honor to a major corporation for the utilization of ethnic minority owned suppliers specifically those with AsianIndian AsianPacific Black HispanicLatinx and Indigenous owners,8
Through our global supply chain we create opportunities for people around the world including by helping to close skills gaps in manufacturing and by helping to prepare workers across our supply chain for the jobs of today and tomorrow,17

Inspired by the impact of our ConnectED initiative and programs like Everyone Can Create and Everyone Can Code we launched our Community Education Initiative CEI in 2019 with a focus on expanding learning opportunities in communities that are historically underrepresented and underresourced in technology,2
CEI partners with K12 and higher education institutions communitybased organizations and nonprofits to bring coding creativity and workforce development opportunities to educators and learners of all ages CEI aims to build knowledge and skills for highdemand highgrowth technical careers alongside communities that have been traditionally underresourced to advance education equity Our support includes hardware grants monetary grants to support scholarships and programming resources for educator training curriculum development and employee engagement opportunities,8
Through educational partnerships across the US weve been able to reach tens of thousands of students and educators who might not have had access to our technology and education resources As of April 2022 weve supported and partnered with 147 education institutions and nonprofit organizations including 47 HBCUs in over 500 different locations across 36 states in the US and four locations across the UK since the initiative launched in 2019,2
Grounded in the positive relationships that weve established with these organizations were working to deepen our impact in three areas,10
Educator development Were providing educator development and training opportunities to build the knowledge and skills that educators need to teach coding in underrepresented communities through Teacher Coding Academies and the CEI Learning Series These programs allow hundreds of teachers from around the US to meet virtually and in person to share best practices for integrating and teaching coding and creativity concepts Through our Academies and CEI Learning Series were connecting CEI educators with Apple Distinguished Educators from all around the world Apple Distinguished Educators lead and participate in learning workshops along with our Apple Professional Learning Specialists,2

Support for minorityserving institutions Were especially focused on expanding our engagement with minorityserving institutions including HBCUs HSIs and TCUs as well as community colleges and public schools in underserved communities,2
In 2021 many of our CEI projects were undertaken in support of REJIs education focus page 60 For example in December 2021 Apple and Boys Girls Clubs of America launched a new collaboration to bring coding with Swift to tens of thousands of students across the US building on Apples existing partnership with the organization to use iPad and Apples free Everyone Can Code curriculum And in Canada weve supported learning for Indigenous people through an app based literacy assessment tool which drove significant literacy outcomes encouraged a communitybased approach and provided learning activities for children to build oral skills In addition we partnered with the Assembly of First Nations on an interactive collection of Apple Books that explore Canadian history from an Indigenous perspective,10
As the iOS app economy continues to grow were investing in educational programs and opportunities that prepare learners of all ages and backgrounds for the jobs of the future,2
In 2013 we started the Apple Developer Academy to empower entrepreneurs creators and coders by helping them cultivate the skills necessary to pursue new career opportunities The program focuses on communities with high youth unemployment and is open to anyone regardless of academic background or experience We seek to spark interest,8
among the next generation of developers and bring diverse representation to the growing app ecosystem particularly among women and individuals from underrepresented communities A larger and more diverse developer community helps create more new ideas and businesses and it gives more people access to employment and opportunities for economic mobility Some participants are also undertaking practical projects in collaboration with NGOs to help use technology to solve challenges related to their missions which amplifies impact even further,8
We offer two distinct training programs as part of the Apple Developer Academy 1 30day foundations courses that cover specific topic areas including an introductory course for those considering app development as a career path and 2 a more intensive academy program of at least 10 to 12 months that dives deeper into coding and professional skills In addition to partnering with institutions the academy works closely with employers to provide direct pathways to career opportunities Participants also have access to a strong alumni network as they move forward in their careers,8
