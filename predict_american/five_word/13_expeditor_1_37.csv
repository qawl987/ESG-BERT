l No Layoffs We implemented a no,18
layoff policy in 2020 at the outset of the pandemic Not only was it the right thing to do for our people just as it was during the global financial crisis in 2008 but it allowed us to be there for our customers when demand rose and capacity became more constrained,18
l Protecting Our People We continued to,10
protect our people with the safety protocols in our phased approach to COVID19 response while complying with widely varying rules from local health officials in different countries and navigating multiple waves of virus transmission globally,14

A Letter from Our ESG Executive Sponsor,12
By almost every measure 2021 was the most challenging year in supply chain that anyone can recall fraught with disruptions and operational challenges the likes of which no one had seen previously A year ago the world was emerging from the Second Wave of COVID19 with first responders and vulnerable populations beginning to receive vaccines There was a sense that we might be almost out of the woods We could not know at that time that we had such a long trail ahead throughout 2021 that would include Delta and Omicron For us the story of 2021 was one of endurance and resilience,17
Fortunately at Expeditors we had our culture and we had each other As Expeditors founder and thenCEO Peter Rose said during the Great Recession of 200809,18
You cant go around some challenges you just have to go through them and were doing that Expeditors didnt progress from having 20 employees in 1981 to become a Fortune 500 company in 2007 through the efforts of employees living in constant fear of being laid off It is our people who are responsible for those accomplishments We need them all and the leadership culture that permeates this company at all levels now more than ever,8
More than a dozen years later his words ring true today Reflecting on 2021 and seeing that our ESG initiatives continue to advance we are proud of the fact that we have had a formal ESG Committee in place for more than 5 years now More importantly Expeditors commitment to sustainability is rooted in our business model and is reflected in multiple longstanding mechanisms that we have put in place to promote the best interests of all Expeditors stakeholders including our customers employees service providers communities and shareholders,3
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF OUR SUSTAINABILITY REPORT,3
By publishing this report Expeditors is pleased to be able to tell our storyhow ESG fits into our companys culture mission and goals and how we are making consistent progress through our initiatives We hope this report serves not only as a source of education and validation for our stakeholders but also as a source of inspiration for sustainability efforts in supply chain and logistics as a whole,17
HOW DO WE APPROACH SUSTAINABILITY AT EXPEDITORS,17
At Expeditors we have been quietly and steadfastly going about our work in these important areas for many years,12
In our report you will see that,12
l We have always said our people come,10
l We have always said that superior financial results are essentialno change there,18
l We have always said that ours is a place of unlimited opportunityno change there,12
What is evident from our report is the power of our unique culture that has organically set in motion our efforts to,8
l Build Green Teams in our districts,15
motivated by passionate people seeking ways to save the planet while saving the bottom line,10
l Create opportunities for youth and,2
l Expand our corporate charitable giving program and encourage districts to get involved locally through giving and volunteer activities and,2
l Organize Safety Teams in every district to make sure we continue to protect our people,9
On the environmental front we made additional strides both to manage our own GHG emissions and to help our customers eliminate waste and pursue their own supply chain transformation strategies,25
Continued A Letter from Our ESG Executive Sponsor,12
These efforts have culminated in several key decisions,12
l We are creating a new role for our,12
l We have engaged a thirdparty to help us complete a formal ESG materiality assessment and,12
l We plan to set our own Scope 1 2 GHG,25
As we gain momentum with these steps forward we will continue to focus on making a difference not only by managing our own emissions but also collaborating with our customers and service providers something we are wellpositioned to do because we operate as an intermediary at the supply chain orchestration level ie we are nonasset based,17
On the metrics front we remain mindful of the rapidly evolving and varied landscape of ESG reporting We continue to monitor competing proposals and standards These include the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics created by the International Business Council of the World Economic Forum as outlined in their report entitled Toward Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value,3
Creation with its four organizational pillars 1 Principles of Governance 2 Planet 3 People and 4 Prosperity as amplified in September 2020 by the supplemental report entitled Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism,10
While we wait for the emergence of a standardized ESG disclosure framework in this years report we are once again mapping our disclosures on a range of ESG topics to selected metrics outlined in the Value Reporting Foundations SASB Standards and in the Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures TCFD that are directly relevant to our nonasset knowledge based business model You will find our SASB and TCFD disclosures indexed in the Indices section at the end of this report,18
We want to thank all of our employees for their tireless effortsyear in and year outto reinforce our culture through their sustainability efforts worldwide We also wish to thank our ESG team members for their work in leading our sustainability efforts at Expeditors I am extremely proud of not only what we are doing but also how we are doing it authentically tirelessly methodically and always in keeping with our culture mission and goals,10
Finally we extend our sincere condolences and sympathy to those who have suffered directly during the tragic events of the global COVID19 pandemic While the pandemic caused untold loss of life suffering and disruption worldwide its impacts have only caused us to reaffirm our commitment to building and nurturing our resilient sustainable organization one that is built to last,5

At Expeditors we go beyond environmental compliance Our goal is to make a positive difference through our own operational footprint and our partnerships with customers and service providers Expeditors nonasset based business model provides several important environmental advantages including our ability to accelerate transitions to more modern fuelefficient fleets as they become available in the market thereby further improving Expeditors and our customers overall supply chain footprint,17
Expeditors manages our environmental impact through a tiered approach Responsibility starts at the senior management level with our President of Global Products leading our environmental strategy and rolls down to the district level where local employees implement and assess environmental initiatives,10
We use Scope 5 a thirdparty environmental management system EMS which allows our employees around the world to upload facility energy data online from utility bills regardless of language and calculates Expeditors carbon emissions We have deployed Scope 5 to all of the facilities under our operational control,24
Select locations use Scope 5 to track additional metrics such as water use diesel gasoline for forklifts garbagerecycling volume and paper purchases Scope 5 enables us to validate data find opportunities to reduce our impact and implement targeted efficiency programs Beyond our EMS several of our locations are ISO 14001certified including two locations in the United States one in France and seven in Germany We aim to strategically increase the number of facilities that are ISO 14001certified,20
We are taking additional steps both to manage our own GHG emissions and to help our customers eliminate waste and pursue their own supply chain transformation strategies,25
In 2021 we took the step of creating a new role for our organization Director Environmental Sustainability,23
This position will help further our external environmental engagement efforts with customers and service providers as well as our internal initiatives around recycling efficiency and GHG reduction To that end we also plan to set our own Scope 1 2 GHG emissions targets in 2022As we gain momentum with these steps forward we will continue to focus on making a difference not only by managing our own emissions but also by collaborating with our customers and service providers something we are well positioned to do because we operate as an intermediary at the supply chain orchestration level ie we are nonasset based,25

Sponsors the Environmental Steering Committee and is responsible for passing strategic decisions between the Global Environment Team and our executives,12
Advises strategizes and ensures alignment across ESG activities throughout the organization,3
Work with their business units to fold our environmental strategy into our business strategy,3
Influencing our Customers Service Providers Environmental Impacts,17
At Expeditors we work closely with our customers and service providers to help them reduce their impact on the environment We suggest sustainability best practices to our customers when requested based on an analysis of their supply chains including modal shifts supply chain speed optimization warehouse space optimization freight consolidation and databased decision making We provide carbon emissions data to our customers using the Greenhouse Logistics Emissions Council GLEC Framework and EcoTransIT software tool This data allows them to better understand the environmental impacts of their value chains and analyze their supply chain impact on a mode and lane basis see Working with Our Customers to Reduce Emissions for further details,17
We also provide information in the EcoVadis supplier questionnaire which is available to our customers who are members of EcoVadis and provides them with transparency into our programs and progress,17
Expeditors service provider contracts require compliance with environmental regulations We even go a step further to include environmental criteria as part of our selection process for service providers We foster partnerships with service providers that have strong environmental attributes such as operating fuelefficient fleets using energyefficient equipment and having strong environmental programs Expeditors is also actively involved in Smart Freight Centres Clean Cargo Working Group and BSRs Sustainable Air Freight Alliance which work to collaboratively bring together carriers shippers and forwarders to reduce freight transportations environmental impact,10
We use a total value approach to select utilize evaluate and reward our service providers While competitive pricing is a high priority we look at the entire longterm value a service provider brings to both our customers and Expeditors,4

As a nonasset based logistics company serving more than 100 countries both directly and indirectly Expeditors is committed to reducing our impact on climate,13
We have direct opportunities to reduce energy consumption and emissions at Expeditors offices and warehouses and indirect opportunities through our relationships with customers and service providers We provide supply chain transparency that enables our customers to make informed decisions about their service providers and logistics solutions including their carbon footprint We also submit our global climate performance to CDP annually,17
Expeditors districts across the globe are implementing local practices to help reduce our emissions Several of our districts in China and India have transitioned to more energyefficient LED lighting and implemented initiatives to reduce electricity consumption through signs and reminders,24
Expeditors has been implementing Companywide efforts to reduce our carbon footprint for over a decade As a nonasset owning logistics provider our largest measured source of greenhouse gas emissions comes from the electricity we consume in offices and warehouses Our Scope 1 emissions come from fuel used in our operations Scope 2 emissions from the electricity we consume in offices and warehouses and Scope 3 emissions from employee business travel,25
Our Green Teams track fuel and electricity usage across facilities through our EMS and energy usage is estimated at facilities where electricity is included in rent and primary data is not available We use our energy and emissions data to pinpoint locations in need of enhanced energy saving programs as well as to complete our annual CDP and EcoVadis responses and fulfill similar requests CO2 CH4 and N20 are included in our emissions calculations We consider SOx to be immaterial to our overall emissions and thus do not include them in our inventory,24
Scope 1 2 Emissions METRIC TONS CO2e,25
Scope 3 Emissions METRIC TONS CO2e,25
Scope 2 values for FY 2019 and FY2020 were recast and the decrease vs previously reported numbers is primarily due to the retroactive application of the new US EPA 2020 eGRID emissions factors and improved data reconciliation procedures,21
A significant upturn in business new facilities added and improved data reconciliation procedures were the primary contributing factors to the slight increase in Scope 1 and Scope 2 in 2021,1
Scope 3 includes business travel emissions only excluding Asia which is not currently measured Nonessential business travel continued to be suspended in 2021 due to COVID19,12
Expeditors monitors climaterelated risks and opportunities and assesses their potential impact on our business in the short medium and longterm We monitor climaterelated risks and opportunities through our engagement with our customers and service providers and through our active participation in key initiatives and organizations focused on climate Expeditors operational model and success is based on our ability to meet our customers logistics needs To best do this we use a nonasset model which provides flexibility to work with a range of air ocean and road carriers,13
Expeditors offices are located worldwide to create a geographicallydiverse network that provides our customers with local support wherever they need Our global operations allow our network and operating systems to continue operating as a whole even when a local operation may be impacted by acute events including flooding or other weather issues Relying on the strength of our global network and Business Continuity Plan has proven to be successful throughout several regional national and global disruptions See Business Continuity for further details,13
Given our geographically diversified non asset business model we do not perceive any material risks or opportunities related to climate change beyond risks and opportunities inherent in our business at this time Our flexible footprint and our ability to change locations modes and carriers based on evolving operating conditions and customer preferences translate into a model that may be less potentially prone to acute climaterelated risks than more assetheavy models We are confident that the flexibility of our non asset based business model geographically diverse network Business Continuity Plan and Enterprise Risk Management Framework around Catastrophic Risks are sufficient for identifying assessing and responding to potential disruptions including climaterelated risks and opportunities,13
We recognize that some operations and offices could be impacted in the longterm by climate change for example due to potential compliance costs or transition risks eg related to a warehouse facility located in an area expected to experience gradual changes in sealevel However it is unlikely that this type of change would have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our overall business,13
We also recognize that it is possible that certain ports may become more or less advantageous over time however we anticipate that major port operators and governments would adapt their facilities and infrastructure in response to such climaterelated changes and adjacent warehouse and office space may shift accordingly,13
Similarly it is possible that customers will seek out more fuelefficient routings or options such as those provided by our consolidation services and multimodal options which could create opportunities,4
Working with Our Customers to Reduce Emissions,21
We analyze many of our customers supply chains and recommend ways to reduce costs and carbon emissions through options such as modal shifts reducing distances traveled and consolidating freight to utilize transportation assets more efficiently Through our tools and services our customers can make informed decisions regarding their transportation footprints Because many of our tools are focused on maximizing transportation efficiency both cost and the environmental footprint of our customers supply chains improve,17
For example Expeditors Freight Efficiency Score FES synthesizes three drivers into a single comprehensive metric to measure the efficiency of the ocean transportation program These three drivers include the mix of container size used the cost ratio between container sizes and the container fill rate Expeditors analyzes these drivers on a lanebylane basis and highlights opportunities for improvement Our customers can realize both better costs and lower environmental footprints by optimizing how much they are able to ship per container and how many containers they are able to send per shipment,24
Expeditors Green Logistics Solutions offer our customers multiple levels of insight through several different tools,15
l Carbon Footprint Summary Report This tool illustrates emissions across a customers,25
network by mode geography and business entity,1
l Supply Chain Carbon Diagnostics This service delivers a more detailed assessment of,17
supply chain flows and carbon emissions identifying opportunities and recommendations for emissions reductions,17
l Network Carbon Reduction Project This tool is our most comprehensive approach and,25
guides customers in reducing carbon emissions through overall performance optimization of the supply chain,17
As mentioned above we incorporate the GLEC Framework into our customer carbon emissions methodology and use EcoTransIT an EN16258 compliant software tool which allows us to report our customers transportationrelated emissions more accurately We report this information to our customers using an interactive dashboard that allows them to easily understand and analyze their data Further information about our CO2 dashboard can be found on our website,25
Global Fashion Retailer Delivery Optimization,15
In 2021 we worked with a global fashion brand headquartered in Europe to streamline their air and ocean deliveries to their European distribution centers This company was receiving air shipments from multiple providers and over 3500 ocean containers each year They were looking to optimize their delivery process by gaining access to greater capacity moving containers more efficiently and sustainably and reducing the level of administration required,24
Expeditors was able to optimize this companys delivery process lower costs and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from transport by 15 by,25
Reducing trucks and increasing barge by 43,24
Consolidating airfreight which resulted in the reduction in trucks by over 30,21
Securing access to road rail and barge capacity,20
Scheduling night deliveries at the distributions centers which led to increased efficiency reduced traffic delays and increased truck availability,5
Water consumption at our facilities is non industrial and used for drinking and sanitation purposes only However a significant number of our operations are in watersensitive areas As such our Green Teams are empowered to proactively identify water conservation methods based on their facilitys activities and needs Past methods include upgrading to automatic sinks and toilets and reducing water used for landscaping We track water consumption at 108 facilities and we plan to continue increasing the number of facilities that report this information In 2021 our water consumption was 13981218 gallons,20
As Expeditors continues to digitize its operations in what has been traditionally a paperintensive business we strive to reduce and recycle our paper along with other waste streams including computer equipment food and everyday waste Our Global Business Operations team communicates best practices for waste stream reductions to our district management who then implement them locally We also monitor the number of printed pages from our online server to identify opportunities for improvement and track paper reduction through a Print Ratio dashboard We plan to report on additional waste data such as recycling waste to landfill and compost in the future as this information becomes available,19
Expeditors has a paperless deployment project that is focused on creating a paperless office environment globally We utilize various strategies to reduce our paper consumption including,24
l Dual monitors at workstations,24
l Webbased workflows for every product,15
l Digital copies of documents,22
These efforts have led to a significant reduction in our global paper use In 2021 we saved over 9 million pages of paper,24
Expeditors employeeled Green Teams take ownership of reducing waste and increasing recycling efforts at their local districts,19
Various teams across the world have implemented programs to reduce the consumption of singleuse plastics and to collect and recycle items that benefit from coordinated collection including batteries and cooking oil We responsibly dispose of all computers and electronic equipment across our operations in compliance with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment WEEE Directive and the Restriction of Hazardous Substances RoHS Directive in the European Union,19
Expeditors continues to offer recycling in our digital solutions services including within Cargo Signal Solutions our whollyowned sensorbased logistics business New plastic and electronics are increasingly introduced in the waste stream as the market continues creating disposable devices To help reduce this waste Cargo Signal Solutions has implemented a recycling program for lithium metal batteries In 2021 over 1500 batteries were recycled compared to 300 batteries in 2020,19
Our employees are passionate about reducing the impact we have on the environment,10
South Asia Districts in our South Asia region had initiatives around electronic waste recycling and carton box and pallet recyclingreuse,19
Cambodia One of our districts in Cambodia provided reusable bamboo cups to service providers,15
China One of our districts in China created an initiative to reduce the use of disposable utensils by customizing stainless steel tableware boxes for all staff,15
India One of our districts in India replaced singleuse dishes and utensils with reusable options to reduce the amount of waste they produced,19
Europe One of our districts in Spain installed drinking fountains to reduce the usage of plastic water bottles,20
Expeditors unwavering commitment to make our communities a better place to live and work is ingrained in our culture We integrate positive actions into our daily practices and procedures that build skills and trust with our employees service providers customers and communities to support strong and effective operations To fulfill our commitment we provide extensive training and support on health safety and security give back to the communities in which we live and work and engage with underresourced young adults and veterans on career development to help develop promising jobs for these individuals,2

This phased approach provides districts with the flexibility to shift between phases depending on the local environment including the state of local healthcare infrastructure case counts and local transmission rates While conditions have improved in many locations and vaccines continue to be deployed we continue to review COVID matters on a weekly basis at both the district level and executive level adjusting our approach as needed,2
