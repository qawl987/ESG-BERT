JJ Cummings Team Lead Cisco Talos Threat Intelligence Interdiction,1,26,diff,empty,,
An invisible line of defense In January 2022 as Russian troops began to amass at the Ukrainian border Talos Ciscos threat intelligence arm started preparing too Knowing that cyber attacks against Ukrainian citizens and infrastructure were likely we increased our monitoring for unusual activity,1,20,diff,,,
The stakes were and remain incredibly high Says JJ Cummings Cisco Talos Threat Intelligence Interdiction team lead We can stop attacks that could result in power outages by identifying early adversary behavior and stopping it This could include keeping the power on in hospitals where patients are being treated for critical care whether from the battlefield or a standard medical emergency,5,9,diff,,,
Throughout the war Talos experts have worked alongside customer security teams to identify and block threats We have offered this support for free along with free autorenewals of our security products and services Its the right thing to do Cummings says,1,22,diff,,,
Providing aid to refugees As soon as the Russian ground invasion began teams across Cisco acted swiftly to help people in need We contributed Cisco equipment valued at approximately US6 million to set up emergency connectivity and networking equipment for use by nonprofit partners UN agencies bomb shelters and the Ukrainian government Cisco Crisis Response CCR teams deployed to Krakow Poland where they worked alongside Cisco volunteers to build and deliver emergency communications kits uniquely tailored to the needs of response agencies,5,9,diff,,,
Cisco also supported the efforts of NGOs meeting other basic needs with a total of US375 million US325 million of which was disbursed in fiscal 2022 Our grants went to organizations like UN World Food Programme which with the support of Cisco and other organizations delivered nearly 80000 metric tons of food and over US233 million in cash assistance in the first six months of the crisis For Ukrainian refugees who are currently living in other parts of Europe Cisco and the Cisco Foundation are working with partners like Medibus European Schoolnet and NESsT to offer medical services education and connections to job opportunities,2,11,diff,,,

Building a holistic inclusive hybrid world,8,26,diff,empty,,
The future of work is hybrid and global Between 2019 and 2021 the number of Americans working primarily from home tripled and this transformation in the way we work is here to stay Cisco was a pioneer in hybrid work long before the pandemic Today 70 percent of our firstline managers have at least one remote employee,9,8,diff,,,
Hybrid is about so much more than where you sit And as a company with expertise in powering hybrid workas well as the provider of networking collaboration and security technologies that make this new reality possible for thousands of partners and customerswe regularly share best practices on how other organizations can make hybrid work work Its not about the number of days spent in the office Building an inclusive hybrid world is about creating strong connected empowered teams delivering solutions for customers and strengthening company culture Our holistic view of hybrid work has four integrated pillars,3,8,diff,,,
Our people practices are grounded in our Conscious Culture which means we intentionally create an environment where everyone is seen heard and included A successful hybrid model prioritizes flexibility wellbeing inclusion and engagement enabling us to hire and advance the careers of people everywhere Weve found that remote work provides opportunities for mentorship and growth for employees at every stage of their career,8,8,,,,
Hybrid work means we can offer our people flexibility choice and agency Our policies and guidelines create a flexible hybrid environment while remaining compliant with local laws and regulations Ciscos latest guidelines cover temporary assignments permanent moves home office and Internet policies and expense reimbursements At every step on our hybrid journey we ensure that our standards are clear inclusive and accessible,12,3,diff,,,
Hybrid shifts the focus from where we work to what we do and how we do it We can offer our people a seamless experience no matter where they sit We believe that the office should be a magnet not a mandate and our new Collaboration Centers are designed to support and facilitate team collaboration connection and wellbeing Ciscos flagship Collaboration Center at Penn 1 see sidebar is not just a place for meetings but also for team building fitness and community engagement Its an example to our customers and employees of whats possible,9,10,diff,,,
Digital technology has the power to humanize the enterprise Ciscos unparalleled technology solutions for collaboration security and networking come together to make hybrid work a reality While workers might once have felt excluded or sidelined when working remotely Cisco technology is helping create consistent inclusive experiences for all people everywhere,11,8,diff,,,
Hybrid work can be both smart and sustainable,15,24,diff,,,
Ciscos Collaboration Centers are digitally enabled efficient workspaces that create a comfortable safe and inspiring environment for customers and employees to meet The redesign of our Penn 1 building in New York City uses Power over Ethernet capabilities that removed thousands of pounds of steel conduit and copper from the building and reduced energy needs by tons of megawatts The building also uses Cisco video endpoints to monitor and measure occupancy space utilization indoor air quality energy usage,21,24,diff,,,

A netzero business is just the beginning,3,26,diff,empty,,
Mary de Wysocki Ciscos first Chief Sustainability Officer shares the strides the company has made not just toward decarbonizing our own businessbut bringing customers suppliers and community partners along for the journey,17,10,diff,,,
How does a netzero goal align with Ciscos purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All,8,26,diff,empty,,
We cant have any kind of future if we dont have a healthy planet Beyond that,2,26,diff,empty,,
the promise of technology is that it enables us to rethink business models in ways that are digital and lowcarbon but also improve individual wellbeing and create opportunities for communities One example is hybrid work which helps enable inclusion because it allows us to include more people and more work styles in more places Hybrid work can also have environmental benefits particularly when combined with smart building technology that uses sensors and lowvoltage Power over Ethernet These innovations allow us to monitor and control temperature lighting and air quality as well as reduce embodied carbon from steel conduits and copper wiring This is the kind of digital lowcarbon inclusive thinking we want to accelerateholistic solutions that benefit business people communities and the planet,21,11,diff,,,
Why was now the right time for Cisco to set a netzero goal,18,26,diff,empty,,
Our world is at a tipping point I think were all seeing the impact of climate change whether in the form of hurricanes flooding droughts or fires Given the climate reality its time for societies to think beyond mitigation and consider adaptation and regeneration as well This moment also presents an inflection point for businesses To survive in this new reality businesses must become not only digital but also lowcarbon Cisco has helped our customers accelerate their digital transformations since our founding and today we have an opportunity to bring about a lowcarbon transformation through our global reach as well,13,25,diff,,,
Cisco has a long history of goalsetting including more than a decades worth of emissions goalsand rigorously reporting on and validating those goals Why is validation so important,25,21,diff,,,
Cisco has practiced a social investment strategy focused on earlystage solutions for more than 20 years through the Cisco Foundation How will your experience in this space support emissions reduction beyond your value chain,25,25,,,,
The Cisco Foundationalong with innovation competitions we organize like the Cisco,4,3,diff,,,
Global Problem Solver Challengehelps stimulate cuttingedge innovation in areas where its most needed Today the Foundation focuses on earlystage decarbonization technology and naturebased solutions to climate change These investments send a signal to other investors about what we value and where we believe the future is headed,13,3,diff,,,
A recent Cisco Foundation grantee Im particularly excited about is Seacology and its Dominican Republic Mangrove Initiative which supports businesses that protect the countrys critical mangrove forests Mangroves are known for helping sequester carbon as well as protecting coastlines from storm surges and sea level rise a great example of tackling both climate change mitigation and adaptation at the same time The initiative also provides jobs for residents in vulnerable coastal areas building powerful connections with members of these communities and demonstrating the importance of inclusion in the lowcarbon transition,13,25,diff,,,
Its important to help validate our impact through external verification because it ensures that our actions are having the outcomes we intend Ciscos net zero by 2040 goal achieved validation from the SBTi under its new NetZero Standard which requires us to reduce our absolute Scope 1 2 and 3 emissions 90 percent by 2040 The SBTi also requires interim goals and annual updates on progress that will keep us accountable,25,10,diff,,,
Having an SBTivalidated goal means that you must address emissions across your value chain not just your own operations How do you approach reducing emissions and driving transformation more broadly,21,21,,,,
Helping our customers and suppliers meet their own decarbonization goals is a critical way that Cisco will help bring about a digital and lowcarbon future The use of Ciscos products makes up the majority of our emissions footprint Our engineers have made great progress in power efficiency and circular design and were also seeing customers ask for more capabilities and greater bandwidth that increase power demands That means we must think even bigger exploring ways to accelerate renewable energy adoption and the greening of the grid Our secondlargest source of emissions is our supply chain Cisco has set a goal that 80 percent of our top component manufacturing and logistics suppliers will set public GHG emissions reductions targets by 2025 and we regularly share our learnings with them,25,24,diff,,,
Ethically build and deliver technology that securely powers the worlds connectivity,0,26,diff,empty,,
As the stewards of the data that make modern life possible technology companies must earn customers and users trust This means being mindful of how our products are made and used and taking steps to address potential negative impacts Cisco strives to design and build technology in ways that respect human rights promote inclusion and protect privacy and security so that everyone can benefit from a more connected world,1,10,diff,,,
Data underlies nearly every aspect of how we work play learn and connect The security and privacy of data therefore is closely tied to many of the worlds challenges,1,22,diff,,,
Today as teams increasingly work in a distributed fashion organizations need new ways to securely connect users applications and things Threats such as ransomware and exploitation of software vulnerabilities are increasingly commonplace Cyberspace has become a new frontier in global warfare For example since the Russian invasion of Ukraine cyber attacks against Ukrainian users have surged,1,1,,,,
In this environment regulatory and consumer expectations of companies regarding security privacy and trust are higher than everand Cisco is proud to be a leader in this space As a large global enterprise we must safeguard our business and help customers do the same Our security products and solutions provide the protection that businesses need We are also committed to sharing our perspective on matters of security privacy and trust so that all organizations can operate more safely To this end in fiscal 2022 Cisco published The New Trust Standarda compilation of what weve learned from our experiences securing and digitally enabling thousands of customers around the world While the building blocks of trust will surely evolve further in response to changing customer expectations technology cyber threats and international data governance The New Trust Standard provides a framework,1,22,diff,,,

Our Impact Our commitment to transparency,0,10,diff,,,
Governmental organizations at all levels around the world use Cisco technology They also set policies and regulations that determine how technology should operate Engaging with policymakers regulators and government agencies on matters related to security privacy and trust is an essential part of our work For example we occasionally receive requests for data related to ongoing investigations from law enforcement intelligence agencies or governments When this happens Cisco follows a strict set of policies and procedures to help ensure that data disclosures are minimized and controlled and that access to our solutions and services remains free from unlawful intrusion We publish data related to these requests including the number of requests by country and how many requests we fulfill or reject every six months in our Transparency Reports,1,22,diff,,,
On May 12 2021 US President Joe Biden signed an executive order mandating more transparency in the software supply chain Cisco stood ready to respond to this order and supports the tech industrys adoption of software bills of materials SBOMs Later in the year after a vulnerability was discovered in the Apache Log4j 2 opensource software Cisco Senior Vice President and Chief Security and Trust Officer Brad Arkin spoke to a US Senate committee on Ciscos response the security risks inherent in all software including opensource software and steps the federal government and Congress can take to foster widespread adoption of secure software development practices,1,22,diff,,,
Valuing privacy and inclusion in software design,22,6,diff,,,
When it comes to Powering an Inclusive Future for All respect for human rights is a fundamental innovation principle Privacy security and inclusion must be central in the design methodology especially when it comes to artificial intelligence and machine learning Training data sets often determine how product design and user experience take shapethe adage goodness in goodness out certainly applies Developers must take steps to ensure these data sets are robust diverse and representative of all users Failing to do so can result in inaccuracies disappointing user experiences and unintended bias,1,22,diff,,,
Take for example Webex virtual backgrounds which are designed to hide users surroundings to enhance privacy security professionalism and fun Early research versions of this feature which reflected the state of the art at the time did not perform well for certain hair textures and styles or lighting conditions In some cases they inadvertently filtered out portions of a users appearance Our engineers recognized that broader more diverse training data sets that were representative of the Webex user base were required and addressed this during the design phase before releasing the feature By applying data that was anonymized ethically sourced usercontributed opensource provided with explicit consent and respectful of individual privacy in other ways we made the training data more robust This resulted in more representative images and algorithms and a much better and more inclusive user experience for all,1,22,diff,,,
In 2022 we built on the learnings from the Webex team and launched our Responsible AI Framework based on six principles Transparency Fairness Accountability Privacy Security and Reliability Our Responsible AI Working Group continuously drives adherence to these principles by putting new technologies through Responsible AI Impact Assessments offering guidance on how to manage risk to human rights and providing accountability via incident reporting of human rights privacy and security concerns,1,10,diff,,,

We integrate human rights into our product design methodologies For example AIML technologies have the potential to make sense of large amounts of data more quickly and efficiently than humans can But they can also make mistakes that could harm human rights or erode customer trust In addition to Ciscos Responsible AI framework the Responsible AIML Committee also established in fiscal 2022 defines and directs governance of the implementation and use of AI across our operations and solutions With this structure in place we are now conducting assessments to help us identify risks and consult with product teams as they work to address them,10,10,,,,

Our work extends beyond our manufacturing suppliers into the minerals supply chain While Cisco does not directly procure minerals from mines or the smelters or refiners that process them the company collaborates with suppliers to conduct due diligence in accordance with its Responsible Minerals Policy In fiscal 2022 91 percent of the smelters and refiners reported by inscope suppliers for tantalum tin tungsten and gold 3TG were lowrisk 62 percent reported cobalt refiners were also lowrisk We also contributed to the RCS Global Better Mining program which monitors working conditions at artisanal and smallscale mines in and around the Democratic Republic of the Congo Cisco is a member of the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals EPRM and provides additional support to the EPRMfunded Sustainable Trade in Artisanal Gold program which benefits miners in Burkina Faso by improving and scaling responsible sourcing tools and practices,17,11,diff,,,

We work to mitigate and prevent human rights risks in our supply chain This includes facilitating remediation of workers who have paid recruitment fees which is considered a risk of bonded labor and is against Cisco policy In fiscal 2022 we oversaw the return of approximately US17 million to 2817 workers who had paid such fees We also work to build the capacity of suppliers to help prevent human rights risks In fiscal 2022 Cisco trained more than 90 supplier sites on the protection of pregnant women and nursing mothers from workrelated hazards We also trained more than 20 new supplier sites on how to implement the RBA Code of Conduct in their operations and instructed more than 60 existing suppliers on how to successfully cascade the RBA Code to their own suppliers,11,10,diff,,,
Supply chain engagement can also catalyze greater worker opportunity and wellbeing One example is our ongoing work to implement the TenSquared program in partnership with Social Accountability International This program empowers workers to engage with managers on identifying and tackling persistent workplace challenges over the course of 100 working days Participants in the fiscal 2022 cohort reduced workers noise exposure lessened the likelihood of exposure to hazardous chemicals and identified ways to work more safely on a daily basis,9,10,diff,,,

Our impact Reducing water use worldwide,20,10,diff,,,
Cisco does not use significant amounts of water in our direct operations All the same we are committed to reducing water consumption as much as we can in our operations and supply chain In Ciscos supply chain water is both an environmental and human rights issue because suppliers operating in waterstressed areas must balance their needs with those of the surrounding communities Cisco requires its top suppliers by spend to set and report on water usage targets as well as to complete the CDP water security questionnaire,20,20,,,,
In fiscal 2022 Cisco worked with eight component suppliers to use a water checklist developed in partnership with the Alliance for Water Stewardship to set water usage baselines and improvement plans Cisco has an ongoing partnership with the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs IPE to prevent and mitigate environmental risks from supplier sites in mainland China IPE has recognized Ciscos work on its Green Supply Chain and Cisco ranked first in the IT industry for the Corporate Information Transparency Index at the end of fiscal 2022,20,10,diff,,,
Visit Ciscos ESG Reporting Hub for more information on environmental stewardship,23,7,diff,,,
We report our operational water use and risks in our CDP water security questionnaire and our ESG Reporting Hub To limit our impact we prioritize water management projects at sites in waterstressed locations For example we maintain a comprehensive water management system at our campus in Bangalore India The campus is a zerodischarge facility meaning no wastewater is discharged to third parties or the environment Discharged water is sent to two recently upgraded sewage treatment plants The treated water is used on campus in an evaporative cooling system for landscaping irrigation and for toilet flushing,20,20,,,,
Total water withdrawn thousand m,20,20,,,,
Cisco works to reduce the amount of waste we produce through reuse recycling composting and donations In fiscal 2022 we diverted 75 percent of our operational waste from landfill We have a variety of initiatives for ISO 14000certified sites We also have programs to reuse and recycle escrap within our direct operations Our headquarters in San Jose California continues to maintain a robust waste diversion program and diverted 88 percent of total waste from landfill in fiscal 2022,19,19,,,,
Occupancy is still low in our offices due to the global shift toward hybrid work which impacts our ability to implement some wastereduction activities Of course with fewer employees working in offices we produce significantly less waste at our campuses and therefore divert less as well,19,11,diff,,,
Cisco also engages suppliers on waste We have a goal that our manufacturing and component suppliers will achieve a zerowaste diversion rate at one or more sites by fiscal 2025 For details on fiscal 2022 progress toward our supplier waste diversion goal for fiscal 2025 see our ESG Reporting Hub,19,19,,,,
Cisco recognizes that climate change and environmental degradation can accelerate habitat loss which in turn accelerates the impacts of climate change by undermining natural defenses against extreme weather like forests and coastline ecosystems We are committed to doing our part to protect the natural world and its species in our own operations and beyond Since 2015 Cisco surveillance data and analytics technology have been used to protect endangered species around the world through Connected Conservationthe first solution of its kind to proactively protect animals while leaving them to roam freely In fiscal 2022 Connected Conservation added 3 million hectares for a total of 5 million hectares of wilderness connected and secured across Kenya South Africa and Zambia Nine wilderness reserves are now equipped with technology to gather realtime data enabling analysis that can support ongoing research and innovation related to wildlife protection,23,23,,,,
