The solar industry has reached an inflection point Just a few years ago,12,24,diff,,,
the biggest obstacle we faced was proving that solar could be reliable and,24,24,,,,
costcompetitive without the need for subsidies Today we can proudly state,12,26,diff,empty,,
that we have overcome that challenge and utilityscale solar is now cheaper,24,24,,,,
than any other form of newbuild power generation in most major markets,24,24,,,,
MARK WIDMAR Chief Executive Officer,3,26,diff,empty,,
Where once solar was described as new energy or alternative,24,24,,,,
This is why were doubling down on solar that isnt simply,24,24,,,,
solar PV is on a trajectory to become the dominant source of,24,24,,,,

electricity generation in many countries while powering the new,24,24,,,,

While the solar industry has many achievements that it must,4,24,diff,,,
that requires us to remember the original promise of solar,15,24,diff,,,

and the focus on solaratanycost has not been without,4,26,diff,empty,,
consequences It is deeply unfortunate for example that,0,26,diff,empty,,
We call this Responsible Solar It is solar with an overarching,24,24,,,,
too many conversations these days include solar and,0,24,diff,,,
ethical commitment to people and the planet It is solar that,0,24,diff,,,

tolerance for the use of forced labor either in its manufacturing,11,11,,,,
or its supply chain And solar that meaningfully supports the,17,24,diff,,,
Besides shaking up the status quo the increased public,12,26,diff,empty,,
scrutiny of the solar industry appears to be forcing a reckoning,12,24,diff,,,
that we hope will transform the industry into one that is,12,26,diff,empty,,
It represents a meaningful commitment to hold ourselves to,10,26,diff,empty,,

business and reputational risks that inevitably accompany,18,26,diff,empty,,
