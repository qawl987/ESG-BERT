goal we support responsible policies to advance,12,26,diff,empty,,
alternative fuel technologies for the commercial,24,26,diff,empty,,
transportation sector This advocacy work is,12,10,diff,,,
focused on supporting incentives that accelerate,12,26,diff,empty,,
sustainable aviation fuel production and making,24,26,diff,empty,,
lowcarbon fuel more available and affordable for,24,26,diff,empty,,
airlines general and business aviation and other,21,26,diff,empty,,
users Enhanced sustainable aviation fuel,24,26,diff,empty,,

In 2008 we set an aggressive goal to reduce,12,26,diff,empty,,
our aircraft emissions intensity 20 by 2020,21,21,,,,
compared to a 2005 baseline In 2011 we,12,26,diff,empty,,

A global increase in shipping volume,15,26,diff,empty,,
exacerbated by the COVID19 pandemic,13,26,diff,empty,,
delayed the retirement of certain older aircraft,24,26,diff,empty,,
and led us to fall short of our goal In 2021,12,26,diff,empty,,
we continued to experience unprecedented,24,26,diff,empty,,
demand for our express delivery services,24,4,diff,,,
due to the ongoing pandemic and increase in,13,26,diff,empty,,

demand for essential deliveries ecommerce,24,4,diff,,,
and other global shipments in 2021 our aircraft,15,26,diff,empty,,
emissions increased 12 compared to our 2020,21,21,,,,
performance However we have reduced our,18,8,diff,,,
overall aircraft emissions intensity by 27 since,21,21,,,,
2005 primarily because of our ongoing FedEx,18,26,diff,empty,,
Fuel Sense and aircraft modernization initiatives,24,26,diff,empty,,
As we continue dealing with the ongoing,5,26,diff,empty,,
challenges posed by the pandemic we will,13,26,diff,empty,,
remain agile and flex our networks to align,3,26,diff,empty,,
with shipping volumes and other customer,15,26,diff,empty,,
needs without losing sight of our longterm,3,26,diff,empty,,
To help reach our goal of carbon neutral,24,21,diff,,,
