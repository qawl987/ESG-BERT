In 2021 our Firm financed and facilitated approximately 285 billion towards the Target Across our three objectives 41 went towards,12,26,diff,empty,,
spanning the globe and encompassing activities across both our retail and wholesale business,17,26,diff,empty,,

Creating actionable strategies for reducing our GHG footprint depends on having clear and comprehensive insight into,25,24,diff,,,
our emissions sources and performance Since 2005 we have been measuring and publishing our operational GHG,25,8,diff,,,
emissions and using that data to inform our strategies for reducing both our direct and indirect emissions as well as,25,21,diff,,,
offsetting the impact of the emissions we are not yet able to eliminate,25,10,diff,,,
Our 2021 Operational GHG Footprint,25,24,diff,,,
Our strategy to maintain carbon neutral operations is focused on the following,3,21,diff,,,
Improving efficiency Reducing energy use is our first priority We continue to undertake a variety of energy efficiency,24,24,,,,
measures for example optimizing the use of heating and cooling in our buildings and to expand their implementation,24,26,diff,empty,,
Sourcing renewables Next we are focused on installing onsite solar systems at JPMorgan Chase properties and establishing,24,24,,,,
longterm renewable energy procurement agreements eg Power Purchase Agreements and green power supply contracts,24,17,diff,,,
We are working to increase the proportion being met with onsite renewable energy and offsite longterm renewable energy,24,24,,,,
contracts to 70 or more by 2025 In 2021 over 20 of our renewable procurement came from these solutions,12,17,diff,,,
Purchasing Energy Attribute Certificates EACs and carbon offsets To continue to meet our commitment to source,12,24,diff,,,
renewable energy for 100 of our global power needs annually and address the remainder of our direct and indirect emis,24,24,,,,
sions we purchase applicable EACs eg GreenE certified Renewable Energy Certificates RECs InternationalRECs and,12,24,diff,,,
JPMorgan Chases 2021 operational GHG emissions were driven by two primary activities powering,25,21,diff,,,
our buildings eg electricity heating and cooling and business travel Scope 1 GHG emissions,25,21,diff,,,
include those from building operations and companyowned aircraft and vehicles Scope 2 emissions,25,21,diff,,,
from purchased electricity are the largest driver of our buildingrelated emissions and overall,21,21,,,,
operational GHG footprint The majority of our business travelrelated emissions are Scope 3,25,25,,,,
emissions from commercially operated air and rail reimbursed personal vehicle and rental car travel,21,21,,,,
and hotel stays A small portion of our business travel emissions are Scope 1 emissions from,25,21,diff,,,
To build on our commitment to carbon neutral operations in 2021 we announced a new target to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2,12,21,diff,,,
locationbased emissions by 40 by 2030 versus a 2017 baseline As of the end of 2021 we had reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2,25,21,diff,,,
emissions by approximately 15 Moving forward we intend to make further progress by increasing our direct use of renewable,25,21,diff,,,
energy upgrading existing heating and cooling systems and optimizing building space Over time as we strive to reduce our,24,24,,,,
operational emissions through these measures we anticipate needing to buy fewer offsets to neutralize our emissions,25,25,,,,
On our website you can find more information related to our environmental data,22,9,diff,,,

Our Approach to Carbon Offsets,12,25,diff,,,
Carbon offsets are an important tool that enable companies to support projects that reduce GHG,25,25,,,,
emissions and in many cases create valuable social and community cobenefits At JPMorgan Chase,10,10,,,,
we purchase offset credits to address emissions that we are unable to abate through efficiency,25,20,diff,,,
improvements or other measures We purchase offset credits that have been certified by accredited,12,26,diff,empty,,
third parties which means they are real additional and independently verified We also strive to,12,26,diff,empty,,
