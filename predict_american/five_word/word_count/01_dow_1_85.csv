WHATS THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN,5,26,diff,empty,,
To continue to improve on our cultural journey in personal safety during 2021 EHSS hosted four interactive and innovative global sessions titled Whats the Worst That Could Happen The objective of these sessions was to share best practices among all functions businesses and regions regarding critical safety topics with a focus on fall prevention heavy equipment process safety and containment and contractor safety Several employees shared their personal workplace incident stories which reminded us that injuries are not just a metric but can also be a lifealtering experience for those impacted,9,9,,,,
Audit and nearmiss data from 20162020 identified an opportunity to eliminate or reduce fall risks As a result we,18,12,diff,,,
Formed a Routine Elevated Work Solutions project team that created a toolkit to help identify fall risks at a site and evaluate ways to make a task safer through engineering controls One of the new techniques to eliminate elevated work included the use of drones for inspections,5,26,diff,empty,,
Conducted a Fall Prevention Blitz to help prevent fallrelated incidents with a lifeguard approach employees and contractors looking out for one another to ensure safety and immediately address potentially hazardous behaviors,9,9,,,,

Contractors play a vital role in our operations and like their Dow counterparts contractors also engage in potentially highrisk tasks while on the job,11,26,diff,empty,,
The Contractor Safety Task Force was chartered in 2021 with an initial focus on North America and a goal to understand best practices and reinforce positive behaviors that were driving optimal safety performance among contractors,9,11,diff,,,

A new Fatigue Risk Management Standard was piloted across sites in the US Gulf Coast in 2021 An impactful takeaway from these pilots came from feedback sessions which encouraged transparent conversations for leadership to understand the cultural aspects associated with fatigue The learnings from the regional rollout helped shape a comprehensive global standard which will be widely released in 2022,18,8,diff,,,
Our continual review of incident trends and nearmiss data displayed an opportunity to educate employees and contractors which led to the creation of the two new standards for safe use,5,4,diff,,,
Dows Personal Safety Expertise Center drafted a HandHeld Portable Tools Standard that included tool design requirements and user guides to help combat incidents associated with equipment such as drills and angle grinders The standard was tested across six sites and the success of the pilots proved the value of thorough standard development This standard will be rolled out to all employees and contractors in 15 languages in early 2022,9,4,diff,,,
