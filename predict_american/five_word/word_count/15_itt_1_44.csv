Energy efficiency is the first step to minimizing environmental impacts,24,24,,,,
while ensuring our production is economical and competitive ITT has,4,26,diff,empty,,
implemented projects across many of our global locations to reduce,2,26,diff,empty,,
energy usage by improving lighting and climate control systems and,24,24,,,,
by eliminating waste in our manufacturing processes,19,15,diff,,,
For example our facility in Termoli Italy recently upgraded its,12,26,diff,empty,,
compressor system and as a result saved 1650 MWh of electricity and 356400 kg CO2eq which is almost equal to the amount of energy 200 homes would use in one year By upgrading its compressor,24,24,,,,
systems our Termoli plant is saving approximately 30 of electricity,24,26,diff,empty,,
needed for compressed air production,21,26,diff,empty,,
Another example of energy efficiency improvements that we are,24,24,,,,
making relates to the two cogeneration units that we are investing in at Barge Italy and Kanczuga Poland These gas powered cogeneration,24,24,,,,
plants will use the latest gas turbine technology to produce electricity,24,25,diff,,,
and supply the sites needs in terms of cooling and heating All this while,24,26,diff,empty,,
reducing our energy consumption and emissions by approximately,24,21,diff,,,
12 compared to existing equipment,24,26,diff,empty,,
ITT maintains stateoftheart controls to reduce GHG emissions and,25,21,diff,,,
volatile organic compounds VOCs other hazardous air pollutants and,21,19,diff,,,
particulate matter Our emissions controls include carbon filters and,21,21,,,,
regenerative thermal oxidizers RTOs plus monitoring programs to,24,21,diff,,,
ensure compliance with all regulatory standards,12,0,diff,,,
Over the last few years ITT has significantly built upon its commitment to renewable energy including increasing our capacity for energy generation In addition to building our clean energy,24,24,,,,
production capability we also invest in purchasing renewable energy,24,24,,,,
Carbon offsets are a practical and effective way to address climate,13,25,diff,,,
change counteract our carbon footprint and encourage the growth of,13,24,diff,,,
renewable energy However our focus continues to be on reducing and,24,24,,,,
avoiding emissions As we define our path to carbon neutrality we will,25,25,,,,
evaluate the potential benefits of additional offsets,12,11,diff,,,
Guarantees of origin GOs are a marketbased instrument that,4,26,diff,empty,,
certifies the bearer owns one megawatthour MWh of electricity,24,26,diff,empty,,
generated from a renewable energy resource,24,24,,,,
Since 2020 ITT has purchased Guarantees of Origin for electricity,12,26,diff,empty,,
from the local grid for the Barge Termoli and Vauda Italy production,24,24,,,,
plants as well as for our Kanczuga Poland site In 2021 we extended,15,26,diff,empty,,
renewable energy certificates to our facilities in Stalowa Wola Poland,24,24,,,,
Including the benefit of the Guarantees of Origin ITT has reduced our net GHG emissions by more than 21640000 kg CO2eq in 2021 roughly the emissions produced by 3300 gas,25,25,,,,
powered vehicles in one year,24,26,diff,empty,,
Over the past several years we have made significant investments in technology resources and equipment,24,26,diff,empty,,
to reduce our carbon footprint These investments and the Guarantees of Origin have resulted in a net,12,24,diff,,,
reduction of our GHG emissions by 32 versus 2019 despite a significant increase in volume Building on,25,25,,,,
these improvements in 2022 ITT began to develop its path to carbon neutrality that will guide the companys,12,25,diff,,,
environmental practices over the next several decades through the ReduceAvoidOffset framework We,18,9,diff,,,
launched the first phase of this initiative in 2022,12,26,diff,empty,,
Friction Italy Pilot Program AtAGlance Anticipating more stringent regulatory requirements related to GHG emissions in 2022 we initiated a pilot,25,21,diff,,,
program at our Motion Technologies sites in ItalyBarge Vauda Canavese and Termoligeared towards,12,26,diff,empty,,
precisely quantifying and analyzing Scope 1 2 and 3 GHG emissions on a path to carbon neutrality We chose to,25,25,,,,

equipment maintenance utilization and hot,24,26,diff,empty,,
and coldwater usage and that helps us,20,26,diff,empty,,
define a progress roadmap by category,12,26,diff,empty,,
As a result of this initiative we have improved,12,26,diff,empty,,
the integrity of our data that led to adjustment,0,0,,,,
of our GHG emissions disclosure since,25,12,diff,,,
2019 which we believe will allow us to more,12,26,diff,empty,,
effectively tackle our reduction targets,25,19,diff,,,
begin this process in Italy because these are the most energy intensive sites across ITT as well as the most,24,24,,,,
Chart represents percent of total ITT energy usage in 2021 by site,24,24,,,,
advanced facilities in their sustainability journey In fact Motion Technologies accounts for nearly 70 of ITTs,15,0,diff,,,
total emissions in 2021 and the three sites account for 34,25,21,diff,,,
The primary objectives of the pilot program are as follows,2,26,diff,empty,,
1 Development of locationbased GHG calculations that provide a complementary view to our marketbased,25,4,diff,,,
emission calculation based on ISO 14064 standard,21,26,diff,empty,,
2 Introduction and deployment of a detailed action list of green capex projects to reduce and eliminate,12,26,diff,empty,,
3 Development of best practices and lessons learned that can be applied to future projects,12,4,diff,,,
4 Introduction of emissions reduction targets for all of ITT based on the pilot findings extrapolated across,25,25,,,,
Our work over the past several years has set the foundation for the,10,26,diff,empty,,
emissions reduction targets we are establishing today We expect to,25,25,,,,
reduce our global Scope 1 and 2 emissions for all of ITT by 10 by,25,21,diff,,,
the end of 2026 compared to 2021,12,26,diff,empty,,
We believe these targets are meaningful and achievable and a first step in defining and developing a path to,12,26,diff,empty,,
carbon neutrality We will use the methodology that has been successfully deployed in the pilot to asses our,25,25,,,,
efforts determine how we can deploy similar strategies to other locations throughout Europe and North America,3,26,diff,empty,,
and to further develop near mid and longterm targets that are sciencebased and supported by data We,12,22,diff,,,
will continue to determine the timing and cadence of our effort based on the energy usage energy security and,24,24,,,,
Working with subject matter experts on the ground and local consultants the team is developing tools to,12,11,diff,,,
energy cost at each site We will update our Board and other stakeholders at least annually on our progress and,24,7,diff,,,
track and analyze the efficacy of emissions reduction projects We are incorporating analytics to measure,21,25,diff,,,
we expect that future actions will include identification and analysis of scope 3 emissions as well,25,4,diff,,,
