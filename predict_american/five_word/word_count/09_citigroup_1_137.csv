this is idealistic but having ambitious goals,0,26,diff,empty,,
From the beginning we have prioritized the,4,26,diff,empty,,
humanitarian crisis doing everything we can,5,26,diff,empty,,
then helping and pushing them to accelerate,2,26,diff,empty,,

And its going to take all of us working,11,11,,,,

challenges facing our society have not only,10,26,diff,empty,,
reinforced the need for businesses such as Citi,18,26,diff,empty,,

Russias role as a major energy producer is,24,24,,,,
forcing governments to reevaluate their,12,26,diff,empty,,
energy security and supply Ultimately,17,22,diff,,,

Citi initiatives help to create measurable impacts for communities across the world To estimate the environmental and social impacts of Citifinanced projects and activities we looked at the following metrics,10,9,diff,,,
Avoided GHG emissions refers to the amount of GHG emissions avoided because of Citis share of financing for renewable,25,21,diff,,,
energy green affordable housing and energy efficiency projects GHG emissions avoidance is calculated by applying regional electric grid factors to Citis share of financing across three types of activities including a lowcarbon source replacing energy use from the grid energy efficiency upgrades and green housing units that are LEEDcertified Impacts reflect the per annum benefit as opposed to benefit over entire project life,24,24,,,,
For renewable energy projects total project capacity for energy is calculated as the annual capacity factor applied to,24,24,,,,
the total project size per annum and multiplied by the CO2 emissions factor,25,21,diff,,,
For energy efficiency upgrades the average household energy savings is calculated as the average household energy use multiplied by the percentage of energy savings per thousand US dollars invested The result is multiplied by the total warehouse value and the CO2 emissions factor,24,24,,,,
For green buildings the average household energy savings is equal to the average energy use of a nonLEEDcertified,24,24,,,,
building multiplied by the percentage of energy savings by a LEEDcertified building The result is multiplied by the number of square feet and the per square feet CO2 emission factor,24,24,,,,
Renewable energy capacity added refers to the size of new renewable energy capacity installed as a result of Citis share of,24,24,,,,
People impacted refers to the direct number of people benefiting from the use of Citifinanced lending activities for small,2,26,diff,empty,,
businesses renewable energy and energy efficiency projects affordable housing and underwritten municipal bond proceeds for transit water and education projects,24,24,,,,
For microfinance lending activities people impacted is equivalent to the number of entrepreneurs and small farm holders,2,2,,,,
receiving business loans as selfreported by Citi teams,18,26,diff,empty,,
For renewable energy projects and energy efficiency finance people impacted is equivalent to the number of people whose annual energy usage is supplied by the project Estimated renewable energy generation annually due to Citi financing is divided by average energy consumption per capita in the country of the project to estimate number of people impacted,24,24,,,,
For affordable housing the number of people impacted is calculated using external reference data on average household,2,22,diff,,,
size multiplied by the number of housing units constructed,8,26,diff,empty,,
For municipal bond financing related to education projects people impacted is estimated as the number of enrolled school children benefiting from new or repaired school buildings or purchases of equipment External education data on average student enrollment by school and the number of schools benefiting from funding as stated in issuance documents was used for this calculation,2,22,diff,,,
Direct jobs supported refers to the number of jobs supported by the uses of Citifinanced lending or underwritten municipal bond proceeds Jobs supported are related to Citis share of new financing for the projects For microfinance lending jobs supported are equal to the number of entrepreneurs and smallholder farmers that received loans For projects involving new construction or maintenance and repair of affordable housing units renewable energy generation schools transit or water systems in the United States jobs supported are calculated as Citifinanced expenditures divided by output per worker supplied by the IMPLAN economic modeling system For projects involving renewable energy generation in locations outside the United States external data is used to estimate the share of project cost involving installation labor and this is divided by average compensation of workers in the country to estimate jobs supported,11,24,diff,,,

We are continuing to learn about the complex dynamics between climate and biodiversity These two topics are deeply interconnected and there is an increasing awareness that climate change along with other humancaused stresses on natural systems is contributing to biodiversity loss and ongoing extinction events Natural capital is a way to conceptualize the various resources and services that are provided by resilient ecosystems This concept helps to inform the increasing focus on biodiversity its impact on climate and the importance of disclosure,23,23,,,,
A recent Citi Global Perspectives Solutions GPS report Biodiversity The Ecosystem at the Heart of Business explores why businesses and investors should care about biodiversity loss The report explains that businesses rely on nature for their products and ecosystem services such as clean air water pollination and carbon sequestration At the same time their operations create direct and indirect impacts on nature that can and often do negatively affect their business By failing to understand the dependencies and impacts on nature and biodiversity companies open themselves up to biodiversity risk that could affect the profitability of their businesses This in turn poses risks to their investors,23,23,,,,
There is a growing realization that we are losing biodiversity at an alarming rate This requires urgent action that is complementary to climate action Global wildlife populations have fallen an average of 68 in just 46 years and human activities threaten 1 million animal and plant species with extinction At the same time there is a financing gap of 598 billion to 824 billion per year for broad action on biodiversity suggesting significant business opportunities Additionally nature positive solutions can create 10 trillion in business opportunities and 395 million new jobs by 2030 These solutions could deliver up to 37 of CO2 emission reductions by 2030,23,23,,,,

The Poseidon Principles released in 2019 provide a framework for lenders lessors and financial guarantors to integrate climate considerations into lending decisions with international shipping clients to help the sector decarbonize in line with the goals of the International Maritime Organization IMO Citi was a founding signatory and also chairs the Steering Committee of the Poseidon Principles Association the governing body of the Poseidon Principles,12,25,diff,,,
As a part of our commitment we provide yearly disclosures which are published alongside those of other signatories in an annual report published on the Poseidon Principles website Our most recent disclosure reflects updated data from the IMOs Fourth GHG Study published in 2020 as well as an improved methodology for estimating carbon emissions and carbon intensity for a variety of vessel types and sizes resulting in a more accurate representation of vessel emissions and the emissions reduction targets needed for the worlds shipping fleet,25,25,,,,
Our reported alignment score this year 117 is notably further out of alignment compared with our reported score of last year 6 This change in alignment is due to a combination of factors including the improved accuracy of the new methodology as well as significant disruptions in shipping related to the COVID19 pandemic The disruptions were most notable in the Cruise segment which saw dramatic decreases in efficiency and therefore our alignment scores driven by reduced cruising activity globally This was however offset by the improvements in the accuracy of the methodology resulting in an alignment score of 11 for the Cargo segment of Citis Shipping portfolio only excluding the Cruise segment Further changes to the methodology may occur as data and industry practices evolve and new IMO regulations come into effect,12,20,diff,,,
To further advance progress in the maritime shipping industry we are a member of the Getting to Zero Coalition which is focused on the development of commercially viable zeroemission vessels and other needed maritime infrastructure for scalable net zerocarbon energy sources including production distribution storage and bunkering The coalition was founded by the Global Maritime Forum Friends of Ocean Action and the World Economic Forum It has more than 190 member companies and nine knowledge partners and is supported by key intergovernmental organizations and governments,24,24,,,,

Over medium to long term In addition to this exposure Citi has energyrelated exposure within other sectors for example mainly energyrelated stateowned entities within the public sector Citi total exposure to these energyrelated sectors is approximately 58 billion of which approximately 33 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans as of December 31 2020 Includes Infrastructure Logistics Not Assigned and Logistics Suppliers,17,17,,,,
Over medium to long term Based on Citis Risk Industry Classification which only captures companies that fully identify as coal companies and excludes diversified mining companies with coal mining This differs from how Citi defines thermal coal mining companies under its ESRM Policy those that derive 25 of revenue from thermal coal mining which broadens the scope of companies covered under the ESRM Policy Includes Coke Diversified Metals Mining Industrial Minerals Energy Minerals Gold Metals Mining Not Assigned Metals Mining Related and Uranium Includes Asset Managers and Funds Banks Finance Companies Financial Markets Infrastructure and Securities Firms Certain countries may see high transition and physical risks based on commodities exposure and geographic location Sums may not match FY2020 10K due to rounding from increased granularity in industry breakdowns,18,12,diff,,,

Minority depository institutions MDIs have long been the trusted source of banking and access to capital for communities of color For generations they have provided essential financial services especially for Black Americans who have not had equitable access to the mainstream banking system and therefore had fewer opportunities to build generational wealth,8,26,diff,empty,,
Research shows that compared with other financial institutions MDIs originate a greater share of mortgages to borrowers of color They also originate a greater share of small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration to entrepreneurs of color than other financial institutions,18,4,diff,,,
But since 2001 the number of Blackowned and operated banks has declined by more than half As of September 2021 there were only 20 Black banking institutions and only one of them held more than 1 billion of assets,18,26,diff,empty,,
One of the four goals of Action for Racial Equity is expanding banking and access to credit in communities of color in part through collaboration with MDIs During Citi focus groups with Black MDIs leaders overwhelmingly prioritized access to capital and capacity building investments to grow their revenue and operations which would enable the MDIs to diversify products and expand services,8,8,,,,
Our collaboration with Unity National Bank is just one example of how were offering expertise and guidance to MDIs We have supported growth capital opportunities for Unity by providing an equity investment and inviting Unity in on select projectbased affordable housing lending opportunities including a loan for 381 affordable housing units in Texas,2,8,diff,,,
We also onboarded Unity on the Bridge built by CitiSM platform to help expand their customer base and we have enabled Unity to gain contractbased revenue as a subcontractor on existing Citi federal business lines In order to help Unity prepare for longterm growth were collaborating on shared media and client conversations and supporting talent acquisition by exposing highachieving students of color to banking as a career Further pro bono technical assistance delivered in collaboration with Deloitte and the National Bankers Association is helping Unity to strengthen access to talent pipeline development initiatives and corporate board seats,8,8,,,,

Citi shares with employees the results of ethics investigations including a summary of corrective actions through a quarterly communication called the Spotlight on Ethics This communication reinforces for employees that their concerns are investigated and highlights commonplace areas in which ethical lapses can occur In 2021 the Spotlight on Ethics focused on select risk areas such as protecting information from inappropriate uses the prohibition on using unapproved communication methods to conduct Citi business preventing retaliation or the suppression of concerns and the requirement to cooperate with appropriately authorized internal or external investigations,0,12,diff,,,

PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY AND ADDRESSING RESETTLEMENT CONCERNS IN PANAMA CITY,23,23,,,,
In 2021 Citi in coordination with other financial institutions closed a 2 billion transaction to finance Metro Line 3 an expansion of Panama Citys metro system Citi worked with Consorcio HPH a consortium of Korean companies responsible for the construction of Metro Line 3 Because this is a projectrelated corporate loan for more than 50 million due diligence processes required an independent review before the close of the transaction Consorcio HPH and the lenders engaged environmental and social consultant ERM to evaluate the projects environmental and social impacts and benchmark management plans against international standards This due diligence revealed two primary risks related to the project potential biodiversity impacts and physicaleconomic displacement of individuals and businesses along the path of the new metro line,10,9,diff,,,
To address biodiversity concerns and align the project with IFC Performance Standard 6 for biodiversity ERM performed a Critical Habitat Assessment to study potential impacts on migratory andor congregatory species within the projects area of influence ERM identified an Important Bird Area including habitat for species such as the broadwinged hawk Swainsons hawk and turkey vulture The assessment revealed that a small area of Critical Habitat 054 hectare would be directly impacted by the project In order to ensure a net gain of critical habitat and no netloss of natural habitat Consorcio HPH will implement reforestation and biodiversity monitoring programs to measure results,23,23,,,,
After a review of impacts related to resettlement and livelihood displacement it was determined that the projects need for resettlement would be minimal Nonetheless Consorcio HPH is working with Metro de Panama SA MPSA to ensure that proper protocols are followed when engaging with residents about the need for resettlement attaining willing seller consent providing adequate compensation and developing livelihood restoration plans for those who may be impacted MPSA is also working with a social consultant to enhance its local resettlement process to align with international best practice including the IFC Performance Standard 5 for resettlement As an additional precaution the projects construction schedule is tied to review by ERM and the lenders to ensure that resettlement risks are fully assessed and benchmarked before construction begins in areas where resettlement or displacement may occur,10,11,diff,,,

Eliminating Overdraft Fees for Our Customers Financial Wellness,12,9,diff,,,
Citi recently announced plans to eliminate overdraft fees returned item fees and overdraft protection transfer fees for US Retail Banking consumers by Summer 2022 This makes Citi the only topfive US bank based on assets to completely eliminate these fees and it demonstrates our commitment to expanding access to inclusive banking products and services that can help advance economic progress especially for underbanked and unbanked populations,2,6,diff,,,
For 20 years we have put measures in place to minimize overdraft fees for our consumers in order to put their financial wellness first In addition to the upcoming changes Citi will also continue to offer a robust suite of overdraft protection transfer services for our consumers including,0,9,diff,,,

ELEVATING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS FOR ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE,12,9,diff,,,
Over the last several years there has been growing global acknowledgment that climate change is a human rights issue In 2021 the UN Human Rights Council recognized the right to a healthy environment as a standalone human right Citi has also recognized for many years the right to a healthy environment and the need to evaluate the potential environmental risks to communities surrounding the industrial developments we finance For example due diligence related to environmental justice concerns is critical for identifying projects with significant impacts to local communities from fossilfuelrelated activities including extraction refinement and transportation or air and water pollution due to heavy industry,13,10,diff,,,
Environmental justice is also important as we consider lowcarbon projects with positive environmental benefits that might have negative impacts on local communities For example a dam construction project to create renewable hydroelectric power could threaten human rights if it is sited without consideration of the rights of Indigenous or other marginalized peoples While we want to champion projects that help combat climate change we need to keep our eyes open to other adverse impacts that may occur particularly in relation to already marginalized communities,10,10,,,,
As of 2020 we formalized environmental justice as a specific risk within the Areas of High Caution section of our ESRM Policy that triggers enhanced due diligence,12,12,,,,

Labor practices including modern slavery,11,11,,,,
Addressing Forced Labor in Malaysia,11,11,,,,
Migrant laborers have the potential to become the victims of forced labor practices due largely to the significant debt they incur through the process of recruitment obtaining travel documentation and gaining entry into a foreign country During 2021 this issue gained heightened attention due to the increased focus of the US Customs and Border Patrol on migrant working conditions with the agency issuing a number of Withhold Release Orders refusing entry of products into the US market that were suspected of being made in whole or in part by forced labor This included several Malaysian companies involved in the manufacture of personal protective equipment and palm oil products,11,11,,,,
When migrant workers arrive in Malaysia they sometimes find that the salaries they earn are too low to cover the cost of repaying recruitment fees and expenses Compounding the problem their employers often withhold employee identity documents This can put migrant workers in a precarious position as they are dependent on their job to repay their debts and if they face challenging working conditions they may be unable to look for other employment given the inaccessibility of their work permits and identity documents,11,11,,,,
Citi has a longstanding prohibition against providing financing to any company that uses forced labor practices as defined by the ILOs 11 Forced Labour Indicators The Citi Malaysia team partnered with our global ESRM team to conduct a portfolio review in Malaysia to determine which Citi clients may have higher risk for potential forced labor practices and whether those clients have policies and procedures in place to address that risk Out of hundreds of corporate and subsidiary client relationships reviewed we identified 29 in higherrisk sectors with high migrant labor employee populations that required enhanced ESRM due diligence to assess client practices against international labor practices In situations where this review uncovered high risks that were not adequately addressed through company policies and practices or when credible accusations of forced labor existed we engaged those clients on improvements needed When necessary we required clients to bring in labor rights experts to audit and suggest improvements for their policies and procedures and we set up regular meetings to assess progress to close these gaps,11,11,,,,
While this is an important step we also acknowledge that due to the long history of precarious migrant labor working conditions in Malaysia and in other countries that rely on similar systems it will take time and continued work to raise awareness to change ingrained practices With this in mind Citi Malaysia and the ESRM team took an additional step to educate clients and raise awareness by working with a forced labor expert to develop a webinar for our Malaysian clients This webinar focused on international standards based on the ILOs Forced Labour Indicators risk identification methodologies and best practices for preventing forced labor in corporate operations and supply chains such as employer payment of recruitment fees reimbursement of debt ethical recruitment procedures employee access to identity documents and proper pay overtime management and grievance mechanisms More than 100 clients in Malaysia attended this webinar and it was very well received,11,11,,,,

Citi understands that Indigenous Peoples distinct identities languages beliefs cultural values lands and use of natural resources may be under threat representing a higher degree of vulnerability Activities that may impact Indigenous People have long been acknowledged as an Area of High Caution under our ESRM Policy and require enhanced due diligence,10,0,diff,,,
In 2021 we put additional emphasis on the evaluation of our Latin American oil and gas clients and mining clients during new trans actions and annual credit reviews to continue identifying clients with operations that may overlap Indigenous territories All clients were assessed on their community engagement and biodiversity management practices When overlap with Indigenous territories was identified Citi engaged clients to assess how they incorporated free prior and informed consent into their engagement practices with Indigenous Peoples,10,10,,,,
Identifying Human Rights Risks in Transactions,10,10,,,,
Citis ESRM team screens transactions under the ESRM Policy for potential human rights risks The specific types of human rights risks we screen for are outlined in the table below Further data related to ESRM Policy screening can be found in the Environmental and Social Risk Management section,10,10,,,,
When human rights risks are identified for a projectrelated transaction during screening the ESRM team may either decline to approve the oppor tunity outright if the risks are deemed too high to address or we may outline what further due diligence would be needed for the transaction to proceed There are a number of reasons why initial opportunities may not move forward including a client declining to move forward with our due diligence review requirements,10,10,,,,
If an opportunity progresses to the due diligence phase our requirements include gaining access to project information that allows us to benchmark according to relevant standards such as the IFC Performance Standards UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights ILO Forced Labour Indicators and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights among other international human rights norms In projectrelated lending this due diligence would be supported by a qualified independent consultant In circumstances where a project is not aligned with applicable international standards we will not approve financing until we are satisfied that the client has appropriate plans and capacity to mitigate project risks For example in 2021 we declined a projectrelated financing opportunity for an industrial agricultural project in Africa with concerns related to involun tary resettlement child labor and biodiversity impacts,10,11,diff,,,
For general corporatelevel transactions eg renewing revolving credit facilities issuing corporate bonds that have elevated human rights risks we have less direct leverage than in projectrelated financing but we review our clients policies and practices relevant to human rights issues to evaluate their ability to avoid manage and minimize these risks We also engage our clients to understand their implementation of those policies and whether they have appropriate staffing to manage these issues and we review and encourage strong disclosures of human rights policies,10,10,,,,
