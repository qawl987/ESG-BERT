Agilents yearoveryear gender representation is moving in the right direction and the numbers for associate vice president and director roles show that we have a strong pipeline of women for future senior leadership roles,8,7,diff,,,
Even though were improving we want to do more We want our leadership levels to mirror those of the entire organization which means 40 of our leaders should be women and at least 16 should be women of color Below we show our progress to date and explain how well achieve our goals,8,8,,,,
Much of the past year focused on building the foundation of a strong diversity and inclusion program strategy and plan But we still made progress Below are the highlights,8,7,diff,,,
We increased the percentage of female leaders who report directly to the CEO from 10 percent in 2020 to 31 percent in 2021,8,26,diff,empty,,
We increased the share of women employees in leadership positions who are Black and Indigenous by 2 percentage points,8,4,diff,,,
We maintained a gender pay equity ratio of 100 throughout our global workforce,11,6,diff,,,
Agilent has a strong global pipeline of women leaders with 235 associate vice presidents and directors who will help drive representation at the senior and executive levels for years to come,8,26,diff,empty,,
Agilent was named one of the top 100 femalefriendly companies in the world an honor that reflects how well companies support women inside and outside their workforces As of October 31 2021 approximately 39 of our fulltime employees were female Our commitment to pay equity has been consistent over many years and has remained stable at a near 10 ratio,11,6,diff,,,
2020 Female to Male Ratio,8,26,diff,empty,,
2021 Female to Male Ratio,8,26,diff,empty,,
We target a gender compensation ratio of 10 meaning men and women in similar roles with similar responsibilities are paid equally With our new HR information system we can now analyze pay by race and ethnicity in the US in addition to gender delivering greater insight into our organizations pay equity,11,6,diff,,,
Five Pillars that Define Agilents Culture and Values,3,0,diff,,,
Our strategy to attract and retain highquality candidates is supported by five pillars that define Agilent culture and values,0,0,,,,
In 2021 we broadened our operational metrics and expanded the development and engagement of our employee population at every stage We believe this model will allow us to have even greater global impact while allowing for customization based on local needs,8,8,,,,
We also believe this model will help nurture a One Agilent inclusive culture that drives an exceptional employee experience throughout the full life cycle of employment,8,8,,,,
Attract Develop deploy efforts to identify and hire diverse talent,8,8,,,,
Retain Build inclusive teams and support the worker experience,8,26,diff,empty,,
Engage Cultivate a sense of organizational belonging,8,8,,,,
Develop Introduce inclusive leadership develop cultural competence,8,8,,,,
Highlight Give diverse talent access visibility to leaders,8,8,,,,
To expand our pipeline of racially diverse candidates Agilents recruiting team has partnered with HBCU Connect a social platform that provides Black Hispanic and Latino candidates in the US with networking and professional opportunities In 2021 we held recruiting events for college students and recent graduates and we expanded our recruiting targets to include professionals and alumni,8,10,diff,,,
Customized strategies with common goals,6,26,diff,empty,,
While the tactical elements of each pillar are consistent worldwide we customize them to each local region to drive impact For example in the US Agilent has partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities to reach their alumni whereas in China our recruiting efforts focus on attracting more gender diversity In the UK and Brazil we are working to attract individuals from underrepresented categories such as professionals with disabilities and those early in their careers,8,10,diff,,,
We might also vary our tactics by encouraging our global recruiters to use the platforms their audiences are most familiar with We create specialized content for each market and use the appropriate platform for the geography In the end these policies allow all Agilent sites to remain aligned with our corporate initiatives while maintaining flexibility in meeting the needs of our diverse candidates all around the world,4,3,diff,,,
How we measure and define success,4,26,diff,empty,,
We use a range of straightforward measures to define success for every pillar For instance we measure how well were attracting diverse candidates through representation rates and newhire representation We measure our efforts to retain through Diversity Index results and monitor voluntary attrition by demographic as an engagement data point,8,7,diff,,,
Another important data point in measuring our DI performance is the annual employee survey which asks a series of questions about the diversity and inclusion climate at Agilent,8,8,,,,
In 2021 we broadened our engagement survey architecture to allow us to analyze the results by race gender and ethnicity This allows us to better understand and address the challenges that underrepresented minorities may face within the organization In the aggregate our engagement survey results are strong Yet after parsing the results by factors such as race geography and function weve found that the Agilent experience varies,8,7,diff,,,
Our goal is to achieve at least 80 on each DIrelated question across all demographics,4,26,diff,empty,,
Unconscious bias also known as implicit bias refers to assumptions that our brains make when we take mental shortcuts that can lead to errors in decision making Unconscious bias can affect who gets invited to meetings who gets credit for innovative ideas and who gets interrupted during discussions It can also affect how and who we hire To help manage our implicit biases all employees are assigned mandatory unconsciousbias training through a 90minute course administered on our online learning platform,4,9,diff,,,
Our bias can lead us to look at the same work product differently depending on who produced it the training states When someone shares an idea or makes a mistake we may evaluate those moments differently depending on who the person is,15,8,diff,,,
After requiring this training for all Agilent leaders in 2020 the feedback was so positive that we rolled it out to all Agilent employees around the world about 16000 people in 2021 Our completion rate was 98 and we are now developing formal learning paths on inclusive leadership and allyship,8,8,,,,
