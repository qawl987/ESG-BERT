A WELCOME LETTER FROM NOEL WALLACE CHAIRMAN PRESIDENT AND CEO,7,26,diff,empty,,
Working at Colgate allows each of us to serve a purpose bigger than ourselvesto reimagine a healthier future for all people their pets and our planet This purpose is shared by Colgate People around the world and it guides our ambitions to drive social impact by being a bestinclass employer and a responsible corporate citizen to help people develop habits that improve their health and their homes and to preserve and enhance our environment,9,10,diff,,,
Colgate People know that we have a unique opportunity to shape a better world The Colgate brand is found in more homes than any othermore than 58 of householdswhich provides a world of opportunity for us to make a difference through innovation education and partnership,15,3,diff,,,
Innovation can move the needle Our firstofits kind recyclable toothpaste tube aims to make plastic tubes part of the circular economy not just for our toothpaste but for all toothpaste tubes We proudly support transparency and are working to educate consumers about our recyclable toothpaste tubes by inviting them to learn more at colgatecomgoodness And everywhere you look,15,0,diff,,,
across our product portfolio you see large and small reinvention toothpaste tabs in metal tins mouthwash in aluminum cans justaddwater tablets for liquid hand soap and concentrated gels for dish liquid toothbrushes with handles made from bamboo or designed with replaceable brush heads that use 80 less plastic than our similarly sized toothbrushes All of these changes help us,15,26,diff,empty,,
reduce our use of plastic and cut plastic waste which is a top priority for our team Innovating to find a better way has also helped us reduce the energy we use in our operations by 37 cut greenhouse gas emissions by 38 and reduce our use of water 52 all since 2002,19,25,diff,,,
We know that about 80 of our environmental footprint occurs when people use and dispose of our products so we seek opportunities to encourage better habits Our Save Water campaign encouraging people to turn off the tap when brushing has contributed to the avoidance of approximately 206 billion gallons of water since 2016 plus 108M metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from the energy needed to treat heat and pump water And recently when we introduced our breakthrough recyclable toothpaste tube under the Colgate brand in the US we included a bold Recycle Me message to build awareness among consumers and begin changing their behavior,15,25,diff,,,
We also know that education holds a key to better health Weve reached over 14 billion children and their families with our Bright Smiles Bright Futures BSBF oral health education program,2,6,diff,,,
And our new oral health literacy campaign to empower people to Know Your OQto understand and improve their oral health quotientcalls out the links between oral health and overall health and wellbeing so people take action for a healthier future,9,6,diff,,,
The worlds challenges are daunting and no company can go it alone So while innovation and education are two ways we get things done its partnership that amplifies their impact Examples are many The reach of BSBF in 80 countries is only possible through partnership with schools retailers dental professionals and others Our decision back in 2019 to share our recyclable tube technology encouraged the transition for other toothpaste companies And to advance recycling we joined eight other companies as original investors in funds with the Closed Loop Partners to support,15,10,diff,,,
new infrastructure at scale That partnership led to another benefit it connected us with Algramo which helped us experiment with a refillable model for our Softsoap liquid hand soap,24,10,diff,,,
To conclude our purpose to reimagine a healthier future for all brings extra meaning to our work for sustainability and social impact Innovation is key to our progress education is essential for building momentum for change and partnership makes both far more powerful I invite you to review our progress and plans in the pages of this report,10,10,,,,

We received nearly 8000 responses from employees in over 100 countries,8,26,diff,empty,,

Another element of our focus on digital content is an inapplication digital adoption platform WalkMe for our customer development teams a module of their business planning tool ATLAS ATLAS is a platform to effectively plan monitor and analyze volume and investment to drive real time decisionmaking and deliver profitable revenue growth WalkMe is an embedded learning application that maximizes and accelerates the impact of a digital transformation strategy by driving user adoption of digital applications and tools Using the WalkMe tool we were able to reduce training time from three days of live workshops and 115 hours of elearnings to just three hours of virtual training supplemented by optional dropin sessions,2,8,diff,,,

In addition we experienced 14 accidents ranging from fractures to hospitalizations that we consider serious according to the Colgate AccidentIncident Reporting and Recordkeeping Standard Serious incidents also include work related fatalities Colgate accident statistics include employees temporary workers and contractors For serious accidents we also report contractor and visitor incidents,9,26,diff,empty,,
The goal for 2025 is to strive for zero harm and zero serious incidents At Colgate senior leadership is involved when there is a serious injury They participate in sessions on how to proactively prevent critical risks from among other things electricity machines and heights with a focus on establishing the most effective protective controls They also participate in ongoing risk assessments to determine if effective controls are in place to mitigate potentially negative outcomes,9,8,diff,,,
In 2021 Colgate People focused on learning from each other to improve safety The ultimate goal is to reduce serious injuries and to that end we emphasized the need for risk assessment and mindfulness while working We also delved deep to understand how our people think about the ways in which work is actually performed so that we could offer ways to ensure we operationalize safety We took pains to avoid blame and shame as we believe it is more impactful to offer education understand how and why an incident happened and identify plans to ensure it does not happen again,9,11,diff,,,
In the past we have emphasized establishing and communicating appropriate controls to reduce and mitigate critical risks and serious incidents and fatalities In 2021 we made this expectation part of our EHS Management System and Audit Program,5,11,diff,,,
Our annual Safety Week is typically an allinclusive event to share best practices and refresh our commitment to our robust health and safety culturea key tenet of our EHS Guiding Principles In 2021 COVID19 restrictions resulted in a different approach with each site holding their own set of activities aligned with their own culture to reinvigorate our shared value of caring,9,11,diff,,,

Colgate strives to reduce noise dust and chemical exposures at our facilities Our goal is to decrease the number of people who must wear hearing protection or use chemical cartridge respirators to reduce their exposure below the applicable acceptable limits We have included this metric as an element of our 2025 target to strive for zero harm,9,6,diff,,,
In 2019 Colgate launched an enterprisewide integrated EHS risk reduction strategy to minimize risks that have been linked to adverse events and outcomes The program focuses on EHS issues and management system elements that have been linked to serious outcomes historically The program challenges our sites globally to assess the state of the current programs assess risk and controls in place and ensure the process is sustainable Wherever possible sites are expected to increase efforts to mitigate risk through engineering substitution andor elimination Despite the pandemic most sites are on track toward closing the required elements,18,12,diff,,,
Our global sites are working on a multiyear plan to ensure that robust systems and controls are in place to address and mitigate potential risks Updates are reported quarterly to a corporate tracking system and presented at budget and business reviews,18,11,diff,,,
In 2021 we continued to look closely at the safety of our electrical systems including their capacity resilience and obsolescence As the electric standard requires a thirdparty assessment every five years we contracted with Schneider Electric a trusted energy management and sustainability consulting firm to look at redundancy resilience and condition of our systems to help us identify upstream impacts as well as traditional elements related to safe electrical work practices Although COVID19 has delayed some project completion and obstructed many recommendations from being implemented some sites are in the process of monitoring and modernization upgrades based on their reports The remaining sites will be assessed in 2022,3,11,diff,,,
Our sites in Latin America and North America modified classroom courses to be delivered as virtual sessions on key topics for salaried and clerical employees One such session that was particularly well received was our health and safety engineering training Due to the success of this modular health and safety engineering training our Europe and the AsiaPacific Divisions plan to emulate the program in 2022 Latin America also has quarterly events linked to significant risks where they start with input from executives and then evaluate their gaps and improvement strategies,9,9,,,,

Creating a culture where everyone feels included and can be their authentic selves requires honest and direct communication Employees need to be able to discuss sensitive or personal issues productively while remaining respectful of different and sometimes opposing perspectives This is why we work to ensure Colgate People have the proper training to approach these exchanges with a common foundation of empathy and respect with the ultimate goal of better understanding one another,10,8,diff,,,
In 2021 we made great strides in encouraging and normalizing conversations around diversity and inclusion Our research and development organization internally developed and administered a threesession training program titled Lets Talk About Race for our managers This program is designed to help managers understand how to create an inclusive environment and productively discuss issues involving race while remaining sensitive to peoples experiences,8,8,,,,
Training on Unconscious Bias and Allyship,0,8,diff,,,
We strive to provide an inclusive environment that accepts people of different religions ethnicities abilities sexual orientations socioeconomic backgrounds genders and more Accomplishing this starts with educating ourselves so we can understand each others differences and the role we all play in creating a sense of belonging In 2021 we instituted mandatory allyship and unconscious bias training for all salaried and clerical employees at Colgate with 100 compliance to help our employees better understand DEI concepts and embed allyship as a daily practice,8,8,,,,

In 2021 as COVID19 curtailed inperson education we worked directly with teachers to ensure children had access to the resources of our program through digital means We engaged teachers as our partners to learn from them and to find additional ways to reach our audience We also added the ability to measure the outcomes of our students oral health education to determine just how much their new found knowledge improved their lives Moving forward we intend to broaden BSBFs focus to include overall health and wellbeing,9,6,diff,,,

Meanwhile with many schools still adjusting to operational difficulties caused by COVID19 we took the opportunity to evaluate BSBF to determine how it contributes to health priorities as defined by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals BSBF has been making contributions to help countries reach those designated goals During the ongoing pandemic we explored ways to reach even more children who are underserved using technology to deliver our message We focused on and supported teachers who could best address the social elements of health and created content for them to incorporate into their lessons,2,6,diff,,,
In some of the countries where BSBF works there are no dentists and often not even enough doctors The one reliable source for health care including health promotion and disease prevention is nurses In 2021 BSBF focused additional resources on these vital health care practitioners through advanced partnerships enabling them to actively engage and incorporate oral health into overall health education We have been working with Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursingwhose mission is to develop nurse leaders anywhere to improve health care everywhereon educating nurses on oral health for children and developing a curriculum to reach nurses globally,2,9,diff,,,
