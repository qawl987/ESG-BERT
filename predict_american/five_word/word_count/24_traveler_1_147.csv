Our continued success requires that we do three things successfully perform transform and make good on the Travelers Promise,3,26,diff,empty,,
At Travelers perform is the flywheel that sets everything we do in motion Perform for us means executing on our longterm financial strategy to generate industryleading,3,26,diff,empty,,
returns on equity over time In each of the past 10 years we have outperformed,18,6,diff,,,
the industry in terms of average return on equity and as a consequence in creating,18,6,diff,,,
shareholder value By continuing to execute successfully on our longterm financial,4,7,diff,,,
strategy we will continue to outperform and create shareholder value,3,7,diff,,,
Our formidable competitive advantages are the foundation of our success However we understand that the competitive advantages that,4,26,diff,empty,,
have fueled our achievements over the past decade will not necessarily be the same as those we will need to continue to lead for the next decade Consequently transform means positioning the company to continue to perform by ensuring that our competitive advantages remain relevant and differentiating tomorrow and 10 years from tomorrow To that end we have embraced an ambitious innovation agenda guided by our vision to be the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers,4,3,diff,,,
Perform is how we deliver industryleading results today and transform is the way we prepare to do so tomorrow Each depends on the other and both depend on one thing the Travelers Promise,4,26,diff,empty,,
The Travelers Promise is a commitment to take care of our customers our communities and each other This includes being there to,10,26,diff,empty,,
help our customers recover after the storm and also giving them the security they need to invest in their families and businesses It,13,22,diff,,,
also includes caring for the communities in which we live and work by supporting academic and career success and promoting the,2,26,diff,empty,,
development of thriving neighborhoods and enriched communities Finally it is about making Travelers a great place to work for our,8,4,diff,,,
diverse workforcethe best talent in the industryand a great partner for our agents and brokers In the end the Travelers Promise is,8,8,,,,
about taking care of the people we are privileged to serve,10,26,diff,empty,,
Put another way for Travelers sustainability comes down to this Only by successfully delivering on our perform and transform agenda,3,0,diff,,,
will we earn the resources we need to keep the Travelers Promise And only by faithfully keeping the Travelers Promise will we earn the,10,26,diff,empty,,
support of key stakeholders essential to our perform and transform success That is how we are going to deliver results next quarter and,3,26,diff,empty,,
succeed for the next quarter century,18,26,diff,empty,,

At Travelers our simple and unwavering mission for creating shareholder value is to deliver superior returns on equity by leveraging our competitive advantages generate earnings and capital substantially in excess of our growth needs and thoughtfully rightsize capital and grow book value per share over time Our Board of Directors regularly reviews this longterm financial strategy Executing our longterm strategy requires that we fulfill our promise to take care of our customers our communities and our employees By executing our financial strategy investing strategically in the future and delivering on the Travelers Promise we will continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time,3,7,diff,,,
Our LongTerm Financial Strategy for Creating Shareholder Value,3,7,diff,,,
More than a decade ago Travelers laid out a clear simple and unwavering mission for creating shareholder value,3,7,diff,,,
Our results in achieving the elements of this longterm financial strategy speak for themselves Over the past decade,3,26,diff,empty,,
y Our return on equity has significantly outperformed the average return on equity for the industry,18,6,diff,,,
y We returned more than 28 billion of excess capital to our shareholders,12,26,diff,empty,,
y We grew dividends per share at an average annual rate of 8,18,4,diff,,,
y We have grown book value per share and adjusted book value per share at a compound annual rate of 7,18,4,diff,,,
Importantly over this 10year period our return on equity has been less volatile than that of others in the property and casualty,18,6,diff,,,
industry The level and consistency of our return on equity over time reflect the value of our competitive advantages and demonstrate,4,6,diff,,,
the discipline with which we run our business,0,26,diff,empty,,
Delivering IndustryLeading Return on Equity Over Time,4,6,diff,,,
The results we deliver are due to our deliberate and consistent approach to creating shareholder value We have been clear for many,3,7,diff,,,
years that one of our crucial responsibilities is to produce an appropriate return on equity for our shareholders This has meant,4,6,diff,,,
developing and executing financial and operational plans consistent with our goal of achieving superior returns which we defined many years ago as a midteens core return on equity over time We emphasize that the objective is measured over time because we recognize that the macroeconomic environment loss cost trends weather and geopolitical and other factors impact our results from year to,3,10,diff,,,
year and that there are yearsor longer periodsand environments in which a midteens return is not attainable In that regard we,12,26,diff,empty,,
established the midteens goal at a time when the 10year Treasury was yielding around 5 and midteens was simply the quantification,4,26,diff,empty,,
of what qualified as an industryleading return in that environment Our ability to achieve a midteens return over time going forward,18,26,diff,empty,,
will depend on interest rates returning to more normal levels by historical standards In any event we will always seek to deliver industry,12,11,diff,,,
Our focus on core return on equity encompasses multiple performance objectives key to creating shareholder value The measure is,3,7,diff,,,
a function of both core income and shareholders equity excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments Accordingly core,18,6,diff,,,
return on equity reflects a number of separate areas of financial performance related to both our income statement and balance sheet,18,8,diff,,,
including the quality and profitability of our underwriting and investment decisions the pricing of our policies the effectiveness of our,12,4,diff,,,
claims management and the efficacy of our capital and risk management,18,11,diff,,,
One critical component of our ability to deliver exceptional returns over time is our granular approach to underwriting In our,4,26,diff,empty,,
commercial businesses that means execution including the allocation of capital on an accountbyaccount or classbyclass basis In,4,26,diff,empty,,
personal lines that means a very high degree of account segmentation and the allocation of capital generally by product and geography,4,4,,,,
With that and our advanced data and analytics we select the risks we write and price our products deliberately with our targeted return,15,22,diff,,,
in mind Underlying all of this is a culture that understands how to balance the art and science of decisionmaking based on data and,12,8,diff,,,
analytics This culture alone is a competitive advantage and one that we believe is hard to replicate Our underwriting expertise is a,4,4,,,,
hallmark of our success and evaluating risk and reward is at the heart of what we do,3,12,diff,,,
We actively manage all levers of profitability available to us including risk selection mix of business claim and expense initiatives,18,12,diff,,,
volume reinsurance terms and conditions and price We have a long track record of capitalizing on all of the available levers to deliver,4,11,diff,,,
superior returnsand of applying these levers on a strategic and businessbybusiness basis This is evident in the way we have executed,4,26,diff,empty,,
quite differently in each of our business segments through changing economic and business cycles,3,26,diff,empty,,
Much like our underwriting strategy successfully balancing risk and reward is at the heart of our welldefined investment philosophy Our investment portfolio is managed first and foremost to support our insurance operations and accordingly is positioned to meet our,3,12,diff,,,
obligations to policyholders under a wide range of conditions With this in mind we emphasize riskadjusted returns and credit quality,18,6,diff,,,
rather than reaching for yield that is not consistent with the underlying risk Our asset allocation is designed so that the predictable stream,18,12,diff,,,
of investment income from our fixed income portfolio will provide a firm and reliable foundation for our overall results In addition our,4,26,diff,empty,,
Investment Policy approved by our Board of Directors reflects a longterm approach to sustainable value creation and requires that Travelers consider environmental social and governance ESG factors in the investment process to the extent relevant,3,7,diff,,,
A Balanced Approach to Rightsizing Capital,4,26,diff,empty,,
Our capital management strategy has been an important driver of shareholder value creation over time Our first objective for the capital we generate is to reinvest it in our businessorganically and inorganicallyto create shareholder value For example as we,3,7,diff,,,
continue to grow our premium volumes as we have for the past few years we will retain more capital to support that growth Also,18,4,diff,,,
we continue to invest in everything from talent to technology to further our ambitious innovation agenda and advance our strategic,8,3,diff,,,
objectives Having said that we are disciplined stewards of our shareholders capital To the extent that we continue to generate capital,3,26,diff,empty,,
that we cannot reinvest consistent with our objective of generating industryleading returns over time we will manage it the same way,18,26,diff,empty,,
we have for more than a decadeby returning it to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases By returning excess,18,4,diff,,,
capital to our investors we give them the ability to allocate their investment dollars as they see fit including by investing in companies,4,26,diff,empty,,
with different growth profiles or capital needs thereby efficiently allocating capital across the economy Over time that efficient,18,4,diff,,,
allocation of capital in the marketplace contributes to a stronger economy,4,26,diff,empty,,
The lens through which we evaluate acquisition opportunities is that a transaction should contribute to our mission by improving our,3,26,diff,empty,,
longterm return profile reducing the volatility of our returns or creating shareholder value through some other important strategic,18,7,diff,,,
benefit such as a geographic or product position,4,26,diff,empty,,
We have a great deal of experience in executing strategic transactions and we view this as a core competency The company that we are,4,26,diff,empty,,
today has come together through a number of significant transactions over the past two decades,18,26,diff,empty,,
Across all of our businesses our strategic focus continues to include creating opportunities to write more business through retaining,3,26,diff,empty,,
and growing our relationships with our highquality inforce accounts and bringing our franchise value to new customers As we have,0,26,diff,empty,,
done successfully over the past few years we will continue to seek to grow without compromising our return objectives or changing,3,26,diff,empty,,
our risk profile primarily by targeting customers industries products and geographies that we know well In terms of geography we,18,4,diff,,,
continue to believe that geopolitical risk and economic instability around the world are underappreciated Accordingly we like our,18,12,diff,,,
North America concentration That is not to say that we do not continue to recognize value and evaluate opportunities outside of North,18,26,diff,empty,,
America but we have set an even higher bar for those opportunities today,4,26,diff,empty,,
Our competitive advantages set us apart they are foundational to the success of our longterm financial strategy At the same time we understand clearly that the world is changing and changing quickly Broadly speaking we see four significant forces of change impacting,4,26,diff,empty,,
y Consumers expectations are changing and being shaped by their experiences in other industries,4,26,diff,empty,,
y Rapid progress in technology is enabling us to reimagine almost every aspect of our business,3,26,diff,empty,,
y The opportunities presented by data and analytics are becoming even more consequential,18,22,diff,,,
y Traditional distribution is consolidating and alternative models are developing,4,26,diff,empty,,
We are focused intently on these forces of change While our longterm financial strategy is not changing the competitive advantages,4,26,diff,empty,,
that have fueled our success over the last decade will not necessarily be the same as those we will need to continue to lead for the next,3,26,diff,empty,,
decade That is the focus of our innovation agenda making sure that our competitive advantages are as relevant and differentiating,4,3,diff,,,
tomorrow as they are today,3,26,diff,empty,,
Ultimately the vision for our innovation agenda is to be,3,3,,,,
the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers,4,26,diff,empty,,
This vision drives our three innovation priorities,15,3,diff,,,
y Extending our advantage in risk expertise,18,4,diff,,,
y Providing great experiences for our customers agents and brokers and employees,4,26,diff,empty,,
y Optimizing our productivity and efficiency,24,20,diff,,,
A key theme running through our investments is that they are designed in large part to enable us to optimize the top line at attractive,3,26,diff,empty,,
returns We have been investing in these priorities for several years while delivering industryleading returns and an improving expense ratio,18,26,diff,empty,,
We are undertaking this work from a position of strength We have the resources and expertise to be successful Moreover our business,3,26,diff,empty,,
is complex and the value of deep domain expertise in understanding risk and the products and services our customers need to manage,15,12,diff,,,
that risk cannot be underestimated as the starting point for innovation We believe the winners in our industry will be those who can,18,3,diff,,,
innovate successfully on top of a foundation of excellence,3,26,diff,empty,,
Underlying our financial strategy and our innovation agenda is the Travelers Promiseour promise to be there for our customers communities,3,3,,,,
and employees Only by faithfully keeping the Travelers Promise will we earn the support of key stakeholders essential to our success And,10,26,diff,empty,,
only by successfully delivering on our financial strategy and executing our innovation agenda will we earn the resources we need to keep the,3,3,,,,
Travelers Promise Thats why at Travelers our business strategy and performance are inextricably linked with the Travelers Promise,3,8,diff,,,
Our Competitive Advantages Are Meaningful Sustainable,4,26,diff,empty,,
Our competitive advantages serve as the foundation of our financial success and help us fulfill our promise to protect our customers,4,26,diff,empty,,
Underlying our competitive advantages are four key enablers that help set us apartour talent and expertise industryleading data and,4,8,diff,,,

ERM at Travelers is an integral part of our business operations The standards and practices we employ to evaluate and monitor risks,0,11,diff,,,

This team facilitates risk assessments and collaborates with others throughout the enterprise including risk owners across the organization and senior leaders to implement effective risk management strategies for Travelers In addition our ERM group,18,12,diff,,,
collaborates with the companys Chief Sustainability Officer to ensure that identification and assessment of environmental social and,10,10,,,,

Board are an essential part of our ERM framework and help to establish and reinforce our strong culture of risk management,18,7,diff,,,

responsibility to various committees of the Board Accordingly all committees of the Board share responsibility for oversight of,7,7,,,,
strategic objectives risk management and the sustainability of our business We believe that allocating responsibility for specific risks to,18,0,diff,,,
a committee with a particular skill set improves the effectiveness of the overall oversight of risks and opportunities The Board reviews,12,7,diff,,,
and acknowledges these responsibilities annually,12,26,diff,empty,,

Board Risk and Audit Committees at least annually and is also reviewed by the Board as part of its annual review of the allocation of risk,12,12,,,,
As part of our ERM process we use metrics and riskreward analytics to actively evaluate and adjust our strategies as well as to,18,26,diff,empty,,
further support our longterm financial strategy and business objectives For example we use various analyses and methods including,3,26,diff,empty,,
proprietary and thirdparty computer modeling processes to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage the,4,26,diff,empty,,
companys exposure to catastrophic events In addition to catastrophe modeling and analysis we model and analyze our exposure to,13,4,diff,,,
other extreme events We also utilize proprietary and thirdparty computer modeling processes to evaluate capital adequacy,4,26,diff,empty,,
Our approach to ERM is reinforced by our compensation structure which is designed to encourage a careful balance of risk and,18,11,diff,,,
reward both on an individual risk basis and on a companywide basis Our compensation program also promotes and drives a longterm,0,11,diff,,,
perspective to managing our business This longterm perspective is especially important in the property casualty insurance industry,3,18,diff,,,
where a shortterm focus could create incentives for management to relax the companys underwriting or investment standards to,12,11,diff,,,
increase revenue and reported profit in the near term but could create excessive risk for shareholders over the longer term Moreover,3,12,diff,,,
results in the property casualty insurance industry can vary significantly when measured year to year because of a variety of factors,18,18,,,,
including the periodic occurrence of significant catastrophes Accordingly we believe that the right way to manage our business is with a longterm perspective with an eye toward creating value over time See our Proxy Statement for a comprehensive discussion of how our compensation program incorporates this longterm perspective,18,7,diff,,,
Our approach to business resiliency is designed to allow us to deliver on the Travelers Promise to,3,26,diff,empty,,
take care of our customers communities and employees in the face of unexpected disruptions,18,26,diff,empty,,
Travelers Business Resiliency Program is our internal ecosystem focused on the goal of ensuring,3,23,diff,,,
that we can operate consistently for our employees agents and customers despite crises and,0,26,diff,empty,,
operational disruptions and accordingly continue to deliver for our shareholders Our Business,5,26,diff,empty,,
Resiliency Program takes a holistic threepronged approach that encompasses business continuity disaster recovery and crisis,5,5,,,,
management With support from senior management and with oversight by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors our program,7,7,,,,
focuses on both preventive measures including technology availability design facility resilience and trainingawareness programs and,3,20,diff,,,
response preparation including business contingency planning technology restoration and crisis managementemergency response,5,5,,,,
The Travelers Business Resiliency Risk Committee composed of members of our executive team oversees the implementation of our,3,12,diff,,,
Business Resiliency Program and along with our managementlevel Enterprise Risk Committee is charged with reviewing and approving,3,12,diff,,,
mission and businesscritical processes identifying risks to business resiliency and facilitating decisions to accept mitigate or remediate,3,26,diff,empty,,
Pursuant to its charter the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the strategies processes and controls pertaining to,7,7,,,,
business continuity and executive crisis management for the Company and its business operations In exercising its oversight the Risk,5,12,diff,,,
Committee of our Board meets annually with members of the Business Resiliency Risk Committee and the Enterprise Risk Committee,3,12,diff,,,
to review the companys business continuity disaster recovery and crisis management efforts Among other things the Risk Committee,5,5,,,,
reviews the enterprise event response protocols discusses how those protocols would be and were triggered for events ranging from,5,5,,,,
catastrophes to local shootings to bomb threats and evaluates lessons learned from actual events such as the COVID19 pandemic,5,26,diff,empty,,
The Risk Committee also receives quarterly reports regarding preventive measures relating to cyber incidents including those events,1,12,diff,,,
affecting suppliers that may impact Travelers In addition the Risk Committee is regularly briefed on the steps taken to reduce future risk,17,12,diff,,,
and improve our threat detection and response processes,1,5,diff,,,
The primary objective of business continuity is to ensure that the company is prepared to respond to and recover from an unexpected,18,26,diff,empty,,
disruption This requires a solid understanding of the risks to our operational structure and involves contingency planning and testing of,18,4,diff,,,
hundreds of business processes across Travelers We have inventoried our business processes and categorized them according to their,4,26,diff,empty,,
criticality and urgency to the company and we have tailored our resiliency measures accordingly,3,26,diff,empty,,
Through annual risk reviews which are facilitated centrally each business function updates its resiliency plans with respect to key operational aspects The plans include specific recovery scenarios and detailed workaround plans to be leveraged in the event of a,3,5,diff,,,
disruption related to technology facility workforce or supplier issues We also conduct validation exercises to test the effectiveness of,17,4,diff,,,
In addition as a fundamental part of our enterprise supplier management program we identify supplier risks and mitigating controls,17,11,diff,,,
enabling the company to make informed decisions throughout the life cycle of a supplier relationship Specifically we assess the,17,26,diff,empty,,
business continuity and disaster recovery risk of our suppliers to evaluate their overall business resiliency recovery capabilities and,5,5,,,,
limitations And we create contingency plans detailing how the company will continue to operate if a supplier becomes unavailable,17,26,diff,empty,,
We base our approach to disaster recovery on a model that provides redundant infrastructure application and platform solutions,5,5,,,,
designed to enable continued operation in the event of a disruption We review these solutions on a regular basis to ensure that they,5,4,diff,,,
continue to align with our business strategy In addition on an annual basis we perform disaster recovery testing on all of our mission,5,5,,,,
We inventory all computing platforms with a detailed plan to move to an alternate site the specifics of which vary by application design,3,26,diff,empty,,
and business criticality We maintain technology availability standards to help ensure adequate designs are deployed and sufficient,12,11,diff,,,
procedures are in place and tested to restore infrastructure applications and data in the event of a disaster,5,20,diff,,,
We perform daily backups of production data from our primary facility to our alternate sites Critical technology infrastructure is,1,20,diff,,,
designed with sufficient levels of redundancy to support recovery from local or geographic service disruption events,18,3,diff,,,
Our Crisis Management Operating Model includes two teams the Operational Response Team ORT and the Enterprise Event,5,5,,,,
Our integrated ORT comes together to manage events both planned and unplanned providing a coordinated and facilitated response,12,5,diff,,,
to situations of all types The ORT is a group of employees from across the organization prepared to come together before during or,8,26,diff,empty,,
shortly after an event to ensure that we respond appropriately The ORT manages corporate security real estate technology cyber,1,22,diff,,,
business continuity and environmental health and safety events This team is activated and engaged regardless of the severity of the,9,9,,,,
event The ORT also maintains welldocumented emergency response procedures and conducts regular training scenario planning,5,9,diff,,,
and exercises in anticipation of potential emergency scenarios Travelers has eventspecific playbooks covering protocols for various,5,9,diff,,,
scenarios including a pandemic natural disaster data center outage and cybersecurity incident For example our corporate pandemic,5,1,diff,,,
plan which outlines our strategy for maintaining a safe and healthy workplace while continuing to deliver uninterrupted service to,9,6,diff,,,
our customers and agent and broker partners was activated when the COVID19 outbreak began Roles and responsibilities of team,3,26,diff,empty,,
members are clearly defined enabling an efficient response to a national crisis or a technology worksite workforce or supplier event,17,5,diff,,,
The EERT manages catastrophe events underwriting and exposure claim response and regulatory events When escalation is required,18,5,diff,,,
these teams engage with the appropriate group of senior executives tasked with overseeing the execution of our crisis management and,18,11,diff,,,
emergency response plans related to the event,5,9,diff,,,
Travelers Business Resiliency Management in the Face of COVID19,3,11,diff,,,
Despite the extraordinarily challenging circumstances related to COVID19 we were able to continue to serve our customers and our,6,26,diff,empty,,
agent and broker partners seamlessly due to our extensive planning and preparation for unforeseeable circumstances the commitment,12,26,diff,empty,,
resourcefulness and professionalism of our team and the tremendous efforts of our Technology and Operations group Upon initial,8,26,diff,empty,,
reports of the emerging coronavirus in January 2020 we activated our Business Continuity Crisis Management and Disaster Recovery,5,5,,,,
teams to track the outbreak and begin executing our robust business resiliency plans In February 2020 the group expanded to include,3,26,diff,empty,,
the Executive Crisis Management team which effectively oversaw and managed the companys response to the rapidly evolving events in,5,5,,,,
Anticipating a scenario where nearly all employees would need to work remotely and necessary Claim professionals would need to,11,26,diff,empty,,
safely engage with customers our Operational Response Team acted quickly to limit business disruption and maintain the security of,5,4,diff,,,
information As part of those efforts we assessed risk and risk mitigation levers on hundreds of business processes while activating and,18,12,diff,,,
developing plans to assess and further strengthen our technology infrastructure and cybersecurity,1,1,,,,
During the first few months of the COVID19 pandemic our Board of Directors met biweekly with our Chief Executive Officer to review,7,7,,,,
managements operational response to the pandemic as well as strategies to mitigate the short and longterm risks to the company,13,5,diff,,,
The meeting topics covered all aspects of our event response and business continuity including our transition to a remote working,5,5,,,,
environment workforce health and safety productivity technology and cybersecurity supply chain management financial results,17,11,diff,,,
capital and liquidity management legislative and regulatory activity short and longterm business impacts and community relief efforts,12,10,diff,,,
Due to our Business Resiliency Management program and our corporate pandemic plan we were able to seamlessly transition almost,3,11,diff,,,
our entire workforce practically overnight to safely and effectively work from home all while maintaining employee productivity and,11,8,diff,,,
engagement Our comprehensive planning and ongoing testing as well as the exceptional response of Travelers employees to the crisis,5,5,,,,
enabled us to continue to deliver the risk management products and services that our customers need to live their lives and run their,18,11,diff,,,
businesses as well as the outstanding uninterrupted service that our customers and agent and broker partners have come to expect,4,6,diff,,,
Balanced Approach to Capital Management,4,11,diff,,,
Travelers has consistently provided excellent service to policyholders while delivering strong returns over time Integral to our long,12,6,diff,,,
term financial strategy is a balanced approach to rightsizing capital and generating capital in excess of our growth needs We maintain,3,4,diff,,,
operating company capital at levels needed to support our current business profile and growth opportunities consistent with our,3,4,diff,,,
objective of maintaining significant financial strength and strong credit ratings Specifically our capital models first address our need to,18,26,diff,empty,,
comply with regulatory riskbased capital requirements and our desire to,12,26,diff,empty,,
y Maintain significant financial strength and strong credit ratings,18,26,diff,empty,,
y Continue to remain financially strong after a significant catastrophe event,13,26,diff,empty,,
y Ensure that we can satisfy the claim payments and other obligations of our business,12,26,diff,empty,,
To meet these objectives we monitor our cash inflows eg premiums service fees investment income and outflows eg claim,18,6,diff,,,
payments capital investments operating expenses on an ongoing basis Since most of our policies renew annually we regularly,12,26,diff,empty,,
reassess our pricing and risk appetite against our capital needs,3,4,diff,,,
Our capital management strategy has been an important driver of shareholder value creation over time As we have said many times our,3,7,diff,,,
first objective for the capital we generate is to reinvest itorganically and inorganicallyin our business to create shareholder value We will continue to retain capital to support growth in our business and invest capital to further our ambitious innovation agenda and advance other strategic objectives Today we are making strategic investments in everything from talent to technology Having said that,3,3,,,,
we are disciplined stewards of our shareholders capital and to the extent that we continue to generate capital that we cannot reinvest,3,26,diff,empty,,
consistent with our objective of generating industryleading returns over time we will manage it the same way we have for more than a,18,26,diff,empty,,
decadeby returning it to our shareholders,12,26,diff,empty,,
Our Balanced Approach to Capital Management,3,11,diff,,,
Over the last 10 years our financial success and balance sheet strength have enabled Travelers to grow dividends per share at an average annual rate of 8 while increasing our book value per share by 92 These accomplishments are on top of returning more than,18,4,diff,,,
28 billion of excess capital to the companys shareholders over the same 10year period Our financial strength is also reflected in our,3,26,diff,empty,,
strong credit ratings from four of the major rating agencies,18,26,diff,empty,,
Since the initial share repurchase authorization in May 2006 and through December 31 2021 TRV has returned 498 billion of capital to shareholders 379 billion in share repurchases at average price of 7028 per share and 119 billion in dividends,18,4,diff,,,
The primary purpose of our investment portfolio is to position us to fulfill our promise to our customers to fund future claim payments For this reason we employ a thoughtful investment philosophy that focuses on stable and appropriate riskadjusted returns,18,26,diff,empty,,
We strive to be thoughtful underwriters on both sides of our balance sheet and we have always allocated our assets to support our,12,26,diff,empty,,
insurance operations not the reverse Because the primary purpose of our investment portfolio is to fund future claim payments,12,18,diff,,,
Travelers employs a riskadjusted approach to its investment portfolio Our asset allocation gives us a high level of confidence that our,18,26,diff,empty,,
capital is adequate to support our insurance business in both good times and bad Our approach has served us remarkably well over a,18,18,,,,
long period and allows us to invest in our businesses with an eye to the future,3,26,diff,empty,,

WellDefined and Consistent Investment Philosophy,4,26,diff,empty,,
Our investment portfolio is a key source of stability and strength for Travelers The portfolio is managed first and foremost to support,18,26,diff,empty,,
our insurance operations and accordingly is positioned to meet our obligations to policyholders under almost every foreseeable,12,18,diff,,,
circumstanceanything from a global pandemic to a significant natural disaster to a financial crisis With this in mind we are focused on,5,26,diff,empty,,
riskadjusted returns and credit quality rather than reaching for yield that is not commensurate with the underlying risk,18,6,diff,,,
Our asset allocation is designed so that the predictable stream of investment income from our fixed income portfolio will provide a firm,12,26,diff,empty,,
and reliable foundation for our business In addition the allocation between fixed income and alternative investments is designed such,12,26,diff,empty,,
that when the market is challenging for our alternative investment portfolio we still have a shot at reaching our target returns and when,4,26,diff,empty,,
the alternative portfolio has a strong year we will benefit from the upside,18,26,diff,empty,,
Our performance over the past two years is a perfect illustration of how effective this disciplined investment strategy is in managing,3,8,diff,,,
through very different and volatile market conditions In 2020 we saw record low interest rates the 10year Treasury hit a stunning,18,11,diff,,,
low of 0318 and we experienced significant volatility in the equity markets that negatively impacted the returns from our alternative,18,6,diff,,,
investment portfolio Nonetheless we delivered strong 2020 net investment income of 19 billion aftertax contributing to a strong,18,26,diff,empty,,
core return on equity of 113 In 2021 the alternative investment portfolio benefited from the recovery in the equity markets and the,18,6,diff,,,
same disciplined strategy and wellconstructed portfolio delivered net investment income of 25 billion aftertax contributing to an,18,26,diff,empty,,
industryleading core return on equity of 137,4,6,diff,,,

In addition to achieving appropriate riskadjusted returns our investments enable many environmental and social improvements As one of the,10,9,diff,,,
largest investors in municipal bonds we provide funding to approximately 950 different municipal issuers with the proceeds of our investments,12,26,diff,empty,,
used to improve the quality of life in communities across 48 states the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico For example we invest in,9,6,diff,,,
municipal bonds that support water and sewer projects 6 billion which help mitigate pollution provide safe drinking water promote,20,20,,,,
conservation and in many cases respond to changing climate conditions Additionally our investments in K12 education 108 billion and,13,11,diff,,,
higher education 5 billion support enterprises directly involved in improving communities and students lives We currently own almost 24,2,26,diff,empty,,

ESG Factors in Investment Decisions,3,26,diff,empty,,
We recognize the importance of responsible investment and accordingly incorporate environmental social and governance ESG,10,0,diff,,,
factors in assessing the sustainability of the entities in which we invest We have traditionally limited our exposure to public equity,18,6,diff,,,
securities and other riskier asset classes Since we invest overwhelmingly in fixed income securities our analysis of ESG factors focuses,18,4,diff,,,
primarily on credit risk Our Investment Policy approved by our Board of Directors reflects a longterm approach to sustainable value,3,12,diff,,,
creation and requires Travelers consideration of ESG factors in the investment process to the extent relevant,3,26,diff,empty,,
With respect to our fixed income investments we invest using a variety of qualitative and quantitative criteria that take into account,12,26,diff,empty,,
both expected returns and risks including interest rate credit and prepayment risks Our fundamental investment process weighs on an,18,26,diff,empty,,
appropriate basis financial statement data management information relevant ESG factors thirdparty research and other information,22,4,diff,,,
In addition our asset allocation process considers the expected return advantages offered in the market in compensation for bearing,4,11,diff,,,
various risks including credit risk and ESG risks,18,12,diff,,,
We have assigned internally developed ESG scores to all issuers in our fixed income portfolio In certain circumstances this process has,18,26,diff,empty,,
led to the exclusion of potential investments or the divestment of portfolio holdings negative screening due to ESG risks where we,18,26,diff,empty,,
believed that the expected returns were not consistent with the underlying risksin other words where we did not believe we would be,18,26,diff,empty,,
appropriately compensated for the risks that we would be assuming,18,26,diff,empty,,
Consistent with our creditbased approach to investing we have also recently announced a public commitment to avoid making new debt or equity investments in companies with significant exposure to thermal coal mining tar sands or coalbased electricity generation,12,6,diff,,,
In addition in our municipal bond mortgage and real estate investments we consider the impact that changing climate conditions may,13,10,diff,,,
have on any given city state or region Since we assume catastrophe risks such as earthquakes and windstorms in our capacity as an,13,26,diff,empty,,
insurer we also seek to manage our portfolios credit risk to such events by assessing our investment exposures in impacted geographic,18,12,diff,,,
areas In addition for municipal bond issuers in the Southwestern United States and other areas of the country susceptible to drought,13,13,,,,
all investment analyses include an assessment of water supply adequacy,20,10,diff,,,

weve observed that the companies that create the most shareholder value are the ones,4,7,diff,,,
that think not quarterbyquarter but decadebydecade as our company does In that,4,26,diff,empty,,
sense Travelers has been managing with a mindset focused on sustainability long before,15,0,diff,,,

The Board seeks to ensure that it is composed of members whose particular expertise qualifications attributes and skills when taken,8,7,diff,,,

We are able to respond quickly to changing conditions since most of our policies renew annually This gives us the flexibility to adjust,12,3,diff,,,
our pricing underwriting strategy and related policy terms and conditions as appropriate In addition to making shortterm tactical adjustments to our underwriting strategy and product pricing based on the climaterelated risks we identify we monitor climaterelated,13,4,diff,,,
risks on a medium and longterm horizon to arrive at a holistic view of climaterelated impacts on our business further allowing us to,13,26,diff,empty,,

plan to manage and mitigate cyber risk Travelers understands the complexity of cyber threats and continues to proactively address,1,12,diff,,,
cyber concerns We provide policyholders with cyber protectionbefore during and after a cyber breach or incident,1,22,diff,,,
The cost of dealing with a cyber event goes beyond repairing databases strengthening security procedures or replacing lost laptops,1,22,diff,,,
Companies may face liability if their customers personally identifiable information or protected health information are compromised,22,6,diff,,,
Regulations requiring notification of affected customers also drive costs for companies that have experienced a data breach,1,22,diff,,,

as well as with the retention of skilled computer forensics teams to determine the extent of the breach We have a number of different,1,8,diff,,,
coverages available and work with our customers and our agent and broker partners to tailor the coverages to the specific risks our,18,26,diff,empty,,

y PreCatastrophe Communications The Travelers Risk Control department partners with the Personal Insurance Business,18,12,diff,,,
Insurance and Claim departments to develop and distribute catastrophe communications These alerts which are distributed,18,18,,,,
digitally via email and social media are designed to provide our customers with actionable prevention advice For example in 2021,22,9,diff,,,
we sent materials to our insureds in advance of five different extreme weather events to help them prepare for the event Travelers,3,26,diff,empty,,
also communicates with customers and agents after disasters to inform them of steps they can take to help mitigate damage file a,5,26,diff,empty,,
claim and begin the process of recovery,0,5,diff,,,
Leading Analytical Capabilities in Disaster Response,5,5,,,,
As part of our efforts to respond to our customers needs in a quick efficient and compassionate manner after a disaster or extreme,5,26,diff,empty,,
weather event we seek to further develop and leverage our leading analytical capabilities We have built a proprietary approach to,12,26,diff,empty,,
assembling data that lets us assess severe storms such as the precise size of hail forming in a storm cell to understand the footprint,13,22,diff,,,
of an event how many customers may be affected and the probable severity of the losses In addition to catastrophe CAT modeling,13,26,diff,empty,,
our approach uses geospatial capabilities which integrate event overlays that aggregate millions of data points from weather services,13,22,diff,,,
our weather models and ultrahighresolution aerial imagery on policy and claim locations Our sophisticated Workforce Management,13,11,diff,,,
platform leverages our geospatial insights to inform workforce deployment and Claim response decisions before during and after a,8,5,diff,,,
catastrophe event in order to engage the right catastrophe resources and technical expertise and begin deployment efforts before,5,26,diff,empty,,
claims are even reported All of that helps us to get the right people to the right place faster than ever before,0,26,diff,empty,,
We continue to innovate and enhance our analytical capabilities enabling us to fulfill our promise to take care of our customers in the,3,26,diff,empty,,
event of a natural disaster Our recent innovations include,5,26,diff,empty,,
y Using Aerial Imagery and Geospatial Technology to View Disaster Areas Through our Travelers Catastrophe Map Viewer we provide agents and brokers with searchable highresolution beforeandafter images of areas affected by disasters The Travelers,5,26,diff,empty,,
Catastrophe Map Viewer uses photos from aircraft equipped with marketleading aerial camera systems that are sent over certain,24,26,diff,empty,,
disaster areas to assess damage Images are often available within one or two days after a catastrophic event allowing our Claim,5,26,diff,empty,,
professionals to quickly assess damage notify customers about the condition of their property and begin the claim and recovery,9,5,diff,,,
processoften before physical access to the affected area is possible In 2021 we collected postevent imagery covering more than,24,9,diff,,,
18000 square miles in connection with 16 separate events,24,26,diff,empty,,
y Combining Aerial Imaging and Artificial Intelligence Learning to Detect Wildfire and Wind Losses The Travelers Wildfire Loss Detector tool helps us assess which properties are total losses after a wildfire event while the Travelers Wind Damage Detector tool,13,24,diff,,,
allows us to evaluate the severity of damage sustained in wind events Our teams leverage the machine learning capabilities built,5,24,diff,,,
into these tools to analyze thousands of images of damaged and undamaged homes immediately assessing the damage sustained,5,26,diff,empty,,
With these powerful tools we are able to more quickly identify customers with the most significant damage and begin the claim,5,26,diff,empty,,
process immediatelyeven before we have access to the areathereby allowing our customers to begin recovering and rebuilding,18,26,diff,empty,,
their properties sooner These capabilities also allow us to quickly identify key insights about CAT events which in turn help inform,4,26,diff,empty,,
our operational response and risk selection strategies going forward Our Wildfire Loss Detector tool won the 2019 Gartner Eye on,13,5,diff,,,
Innovation Award and a CIO 100 Award,15,3,diff,,,
y Using Smartphones for Quicker Safer Claim Inspections Thanks to innovative virtual inspection and measurement technology we are able to transform smartphone photos of a property into an accurate 3D model so that our Claim professionals can easily,0,26,diff,empty,,
inspect property damage without climbing ladders and our policyholders can provide information without having to schedule an,5,26,diff,empty,,
onsite inspection In other words after a disaster or another covered loss we are creating a faster and easier claim process for,5,26,diff,empty,,
our customers and a safer environment for our employees In 2021 we continued to accelerate the widespread use of this and,15,26,diff,empty,,
other virtual claim inspection tools when appropriate For example in 2021 we handled 35 more auto appraisals and 70 more,12,26,diff,empty,,
property water claims virtually as compared to prepandemic levels,20,20,,,,
Where possible we also gather data from controlled tests to improve prevention and preparation For example Travelers supports,2,9,diff,,,
the Insurance Institute for Business Home Safety IBHS which has a oneofakind controlled research facility that can generate,9,4,diff,,,
hurricaneforce winds hail and winddriven rain and embers The studies conducted in this facility allow IBHS and supporting members,13,26,diff,empty,,
such as Travelers to study the impacts of weather events in realworld scenarios they also allow us to analyze the results to better,13,26,diff,empty,,
respond to events and protect our customers and their assets For more information on IBHS and the ongoing work Travelers supports see our illustrative initiative regarding IBHS,12,26,diff,empty,,
Our sustained investment in innovative catastrophe response strategies sets Travelers apart from our peers We handle customer claims,5,5,,,,
including all catastrophe CAT claims with specially trained Travelers employees we do not generally contract CAT claims to third,0,26,diff,empty,,
party adjusters We employ more than 350 dedicated catastrophe response specialists across North America prepared to deploy on,5,5,,,,
24 hours notice Operational and logistical support specialists at the National Catastrophe Center support this CAT team which also,5,26,diff,empty,,
partners closely with our nearly 2000 property Claim professionals to respond to losses promptly efficiently and compassionately,12,26,diff,empty,,
In 2021 we continued to face unique challenges related to a high level of CAT events during the ongoing pandemic We responded to,13,26,diff,empty,,
71 CAT events and adjusted virtually all of the related claims with our own employees ie without the need for outside adjusters Our,12,26,diff,empty,,
inhouse claim capability allowed us to quickly implement procedures to handle claims virtually when possible and safely in person when,0,26,diff,empty,,
needed with a consistently high standard of customer service This capability is a competitive advantage that results in a better outcome,4,4,,,,
for our customers and a more efficient outcome for us,24,26,diff,empty,,
We leverage our Loss Consultation teamthe first such team in the industryin support of customers impacted by the largest,18,26,diff,empty,,
catastrophe events Our Loss Consultation team consists of Property and Auto coverage experts who are available seven days a week to,18,26,diff,empty,,
give our customers and agents the information they need to make an informed decision regarding whether to file a claim In some cases,12,26,diff,empty,,
they can also immediately process the claim after confirming coverage,12,26,diff,empty,,
Our sophisticated workforce management programs help us quickly organize triage and deploy Claim professionals with the right,8,11,diff,,,
expertise to the affected area We leverage the power of 30000 employees to support our response efforts in the event of a large catastrophe We make considerable investments in training our Claim staff and crosstrain thousands of employees to handle lower severity catastrophe claims This allows our catastrophe and claim experts to focus on highseverity claims without sacrificing quality,5,9,diff,,,
Our team follows a catastrophe playbook that includes resource deployment and communication to our customers throughout our,3,8,diff,,,
process Our Claim department regularly conducts tabletop exercises to test our readiness to respond to different disaster scenarios,5,26,diff,empty,,
including storms wildfires earthquakes cyber attacks and manmade events The purpose of these exercises is to evaluate and improve,13,13,,,,
our response to events identify any gaps in resources and implement a coordinated recovery strategy that prioritizes resources required,12,5,diff,,,
Our fleet of selfcontained Mobile Claim Offices brings immediate claim service to our customers who can stay connected using our,24,6,diff,,,
satellite technology and power their smart devices at our generatordriven charging stations Beginning in 2020 we implemented COVID19,24,24,,,,
safety and social distancing protocols to safely deploy our Mobile Claim Offices to support our customers following a catastrophe,9,6,diff,,,
Our National Catastrophe Center staffed by fulltime catastrophe management professionals allows us to plan and coordinate response activities in a secure environment away from the disaster areabefore during and after an event Our technical experts,5,5,,,,
monitor weather 247 and overlay patterns with claim trends and our customers locations This approach enables us to identify,13,4,diff,,,
potential events early and to transform information quickly into action Additionally our command center is equipped with state,5,26,diff,empty,,
oftheart data management visualization and teleconferencing tools and is linked to hundreds of data sources including the Global,22,22,,,,
Forecast System the National Weather Service Doppler radar network Travelers Customer Service Centers and our internal systems,3,6,diff,,,
that track claim metrics and staff resource availability These capabilities provide us with the ability to deploy resources effectively and,17,26,diff,empty,,
on a timely basis which in turn allows us to better assist our customers and to respond to and resolve claims more quickly,12,26,diff,empty,,
For more information about how we help our customers and agents manage catastrophic weather events see our Travelers Emergency Response video,5,9,diff,,,
Overall our catastrophe CAT response approach enables Travelers to respond quickly effectively and compassionatelyand,5,5,,,,
with integritywhen our customers need us most Despite the added logistical difficulties inherent in CAT response our CAT claim,4,5,diff,,,
performance consistently meets or exceeds our internal benchmarks for claim handling In 2021 approximately,0,8,diff,,,
y 92 of property claims arising out of CAT events were resolved within 30 days of receipt of the claim notice,12,26,diff,empty,,
y 83 of CAT claims were paid within a week of inspection,0,26,diff,empty,,
y 54 of CAT claims were paid the same day as inspection1,12,26,diff,empty,,
These results were particularly remarkable given that we responded to 71 catastrophe events and over 100000 catastrophe notices of loss in 2021 In addition to being good for our customers our ability to quickly adjust claims plays an important role in helping our communities in their recovery efforts This short documentary demonstrates the impact our CAT response can have on customers agents and brokers and communities,5,5,,,,

In addition to opioids devastating effects on society the costs associated with opioid addiction are taking an increasing financial toll,2,26,diff,empty,,

Using Our Data and Analytics to Help Reduce Addiction,2,22,diff,,,
By analyzing workers compensation claim data Travelers created the Early Severity Predictor model which can help identify an injured employees likelihood of experiencing chronic pain using weighted predictors at key points during the life of a claim By adjusting medical care and resources the Early Severity Predictor model can help address potential drivers of chronic paina condition that is largely treated with opioids or other painkillersand reduce the risk of opioid addiction,9,11,diff,,,

Construction sites present health and safety risks that can lead to worker injuries such as strains sprains broken bones and head,9,6,diff,,,

to reduce the risk of opioid dependency With these two efforts combined we have seen a nearly 50 reduction in the use of opioids,2,12,diff,,,

Furthermore our nurses and Claim professionals review claims and create specific action plans for injuries that often include physical,9,9,,,,
therapy and other interventions to prevent acute pain from becoming chronic This approach is particularly significant for the,9,26,diff,empty,,
construction industry where Travelers claim data show that injured workers who suffer from chronic pain can be out of work for,9,22,diff,,,
significantly longer periods of time than those in other industries,24,26,diff,empty,,
Engaging Injured Employees in Recovery,9,5,diff,,,

The performance of our investment portfolioa key source of stability and strength for Travelerscontinues to be exceptional Our,18,8,diff,,,
investment portfolio is managed first and foremost to support our insurance operations and accordingly is positioned to meet our,3,18,diff,,,
obligations to policyholders under almost every foreseeable circumstanceanything from a global pandemic to a significant natural,12,26,diff,empty,,
disaster to a financial crisis With this in mind we are focused on riskadjusted returns and credit quality rather than reaching for yield,18,6,diff,,,
that is not commensurate with the underlying risk,18,12,diff,,,
Our asset allocation is designed so that the predictable stream of investment income from our fixed income portfolio will provide a firm,12,26,diff,empty,,
and reliable foundation for our business In addition the allocation between fixed income and alternative investments is designed such,12,26,diff,empty,,
that when the market is challenging for our alternative investment portfolio we still have a shot at reaching our target returns and when,4,26,diff,empty,,
the alternative portfolio has a strong year we will benefit from the upside,18,26,diff,empty,,
Our performance over the past two years is a perfect illustration of how effective this disciplined investment strategy is in managing,3,8,diff,,,
through very different and volatile market conditions In 2020 we saw record low interest rates the 10year Treasury hit a stunning,18,11,diff,,,
low of 0318 and we experienced significant volatility in the equity markets that negatively impacted the returns from our alternative,18,6,diff,,,
investment portfolio Nonetheless we delivered strong 2020 net investment income of 19 billion aftertax contributing to a strong,18,26,diff,empty,,
core return on equity of 113 In 2021 the alternative investment portfolio benefited from the recovery in the equity markets and the,18,6,diff,,,
same disciplined strategy and wellconstructed portfolio delivered net investment income of 25 billion aftertax contributing to an,18,26,diff,empty,,
industryleading core return on equity of 137,4,6,diff,,,
Strategy not serendipity drove these strong results throughout two very different economic and market environmentsthat is the,4,26,diff,empty,,
value of our thoughtful and disciplined approach,10,26,diff,empty,,
Underwriting excellence is of course key to our success and there is nothing more critical to underwriting excellence than a culture,0,8,diff,,,
that values strong performance over time and understands how to balance the art and science of decision making based on data and,4,0,diff,,,
analytics This culture alone is a significant competitive advantage and one that we believe is very hard to replicate,4,4,,,,
A critical component of our culture is our granular approach to underwriting In our commercial businesses that means execution on,3,8,diff,,,
an accountbyaccount or classbyclass basis In personal lines it means a very high degree of segmentation by account product and,15,4,diff,,,
geography With that and our advanced data and analytics we thoughtfully select the risks we write and price our products deliberately,15,22,diff,,,
with our target return in mind,18,26,diff,empty,,
Given the elevated frequency and severity of catastrophes in recent years including once again in 2021 we will take a moment to,13,26,diff,empty,,
highlight the work we have done over the last several years in terms of the strategic management of our catastrophe exposure,18,11,diff,,,
Underwriting excellence is of course key to our success and theres nothing more critical to underwriting excellence than a culture that,0,8,diff,,,
values strong performance over time and understands how to balance the art and science of decision making based on data and analytics,4,0,diff,,,
Consistent with our general approach of recognizing assessing and addressing trends rapidly we have taken decisive action in anticipation,18,4,diff,,,
of continued elevated weather frequency and severity Our efforts started with talent We have added experts in data science meteorology,13,8,diff,,,
geophysics and environmental engineering among others to our catastrophe management organization We have also established,13,9,diff,,,
dedicated teams for each catastrophe peril with the goal of developing industryleading scientific and underwriting expertise,18,26,diff,empty,,
We have incorporated the learnings into our product development risk selection pricing capital allocation and claim response The,4,4,,,,
insights we have developed have enabled us to supplement standard vendor catastrophe models with our own sophisticated peril,4,26,diff,empty,,
byperil view This gives us a refined granular view of catastrophe risk incorporating proprietary variables such as complex roof,18,12,diff,,,
characteristics tree and brush density and location intelligence down to the parcel level These variables are incorporated into our,23,26,diff,empty,,
product development enhancing our segmentation They are also integrated into proprietary algorithms that we use at the point of sale,15,4,diff,,,
to inform risk selection and decisions about terms and conditions,4,11,diff,,,
Taken together these efforts have enabled us to manage our exposure to catastrophes more effectively and while there is always the,13,26,diff,empty,,
potential for us to have outsized exposure to an event the positive impact on our results this year and in recent years is evident In 2021,18,10,diff,,,
our share of both wildfire and hurricane peril losses was several percentage points lower than our market share in the affected areas,13,4,diff,,,
Over the past five years our share of property casualty losses relative to total domestic PC industry losses has declined significantly,18,4,diff,,,

Consistent and Successful LongTerm Financial Strategy Delivers Shareholder Value,3,7,diff,,,
It is important to consider our financial results and our strategic initiatives in the context of what we are ultimately trying to achieve At,3,26,diff,empty,,
Travelers our simple and unwavering mission for creating shareholder value is to,3,7,diff,,,
y Deliver superior returns on equity by leveraging our competitive advantages,4,6,diff,,,
y Generate earnings and capital substantially in excess of our growth needs,3,4,diff,,,
y Thoughtfully rightsize capital and grow book value per share over time,4,4,,,,
The results we deliver are due to our deliberate and consistent approach to creating shareholder value We have been clear for many,3,7,diff,,,
years that one of our crucial responsibilities is to produce an appropriate return on equity for our shareholders This has meant,4,6,diff,,,
developing and executing financial and operational plans consistent with our goal of achieving superior returns which we defined many,3,26,diff,empty,,
years ago as a midteens core return on equity over time We emphasize that the objective is measured over time because we recognize that the macroeconomic environment loss cost trends weather and geopolitical and other factors impact our results from year to,18,10,diff,,,
year and that there are yearsor longer periodsand environments in which a midteens return is not attainable In that regard we,12,26,diff,empty,,
established the midteens goal at a time when the 10year Treasury was yielding around 5 and midteens was simply the quantification,4,26,diff,empty,,
of what qualified as an industryleading return in that environment As we have said before our ability to achieve a midteens return over,4,26,diff,empty,,
time going forward will depend on interest rates returning to more normal levels by historical standards In any event we always seek to,12,11,diff,,,

Our capital management strategy has been an important driver of shareholder value creation over time Our first objective for the,3,7,diff,,,
capital we generate is to reinvest it in our businessorganically and inorganicallyto create shareholder value For example as we,3,7,diff,,,
continue to grow our top line as we have for the past few years we will retain more capital to support that growth Also we continue to,3,4,diff,,,
invest in everything from talent to technology to further our ambitious innovation agenda and advance our strategic objectives,8,3,diff,,,
Having said that we are disciplined stewards of our shareholders capital To the extent that we generate capital that we cannot reinvest,3,26,diff,empty,,
consistent with our objective of generating industryleading returns over time we will manage it the same way we have for more than,18,26,diff,empty,,
a decadeby returning it to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases By returning excess capital to our investors,4,4,,,,
we give them the ability to allocate their investment dollars as they see fit including by investing in companies with different growth,4,4,,,,
