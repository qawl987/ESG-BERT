greenhouse gas emissions come from manufac,25
turing plants and our products solutions and,15
services are creating a more sustainable planet,23
by helping our customers use less fuel electricity and water to make the products we need We,15
are also helping renewable energy providers,24

To accelerate our work we expanded our corporate,3
sustainability team and function in 2021 with additional,3
investment and resources Led by Tom OReilly in a newly created role of Vice President Sustainability the team elevates and aligns our holistic strategy and crossfunctional workstreams focused on,3
The teams expansion follows our 2020 materiality assessment,12
and updated sustainability strategy and priorities including a new,3
goal to be carbon neutral for Scope 1 direct and Scope 2 indirect,24

we expanded our reporting portfolio with our first disclosure,12
report that follows the Global Reporting Initiative GRI framework,12
GRI is one of the most widely used standards for sustainability,14
reporting Additionally we released our first Task Force on,12
Climaterelated Financial Disclosures TCFD report which,13
describes how we incorporate climate risk into our enterprise,13
These reports as well as our Sustainability Accounting Standards Board SASB data are available at the newly designed sustainability section of our website Online enhancements include more details about our sustainability,12

Listed on leading indices for two decades,18
For two decades weve been listed on leading sustainability indices and 2021,18
was no different We were named to the FTSE4Good Index Series for the,18
20th time The Index is designed to measure the performance of companies,18
demonstrating strong Environmental Social and Governance practices,10
We were also listed on the North America Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes,18
for the 11th time The pioneering series of global sustainability benchmarks,18

unlocks access to valuable production data and insights that,1
improve processes efficiency and drive sustainable innovation,24
Organizations recognize they must be good stewards of resources,23
whether it be water air gas electricity steam materials or people,21
Sustainability is a growing stakeholder concern with increasing,15
demands to do business in ways that are more productive and,15
responsible Like us at least onefifth of the worlds largest companies have declared net zero emissions goals1,21
The quickest way we can accelerate our sustainability journey is by,3
helping our customers accelerate theirs through our decades of,15

Pandemic prompts parents and caretakers to form new employee resource group Even before the pandemic upended our lives parents,5
and caretakers felt the squeeze of balancing jobs and families Almost overnight some employees were juggling parenting work and schoolsometimes with everyone at the same kitchen tablewhile others were trying to look after older relatives To create a community of support and resources a group of employees formed our Parents CareTakers PaCT Employee Resource Group ERG,2
PaCTs mission is to act as an advocate and change agent for working parents and caretakers increasing visibility to their challenges and removing barriers In its first year PaCT initiated the effort to add breast milk shipping as a reimbursable benefit for Rockwell employees traveling overnight for business According to the annual Society for Human Resource Management SHRM Benefits Survey we are one of only a small percentage of companies that offer this benefit,2
With more than 250 global members PaCT is our newest of 14 ERGs Overall we have 61 ERG chapters across 21 countries with more than 6000 members,8
We also created a Balance Resources information hub with quizzes webinars,12

Seeking to destigmatize mental health many of our employees shared stories about,9

had different experiences over the past two years Through our Global Voices survey,8
one of our most important checkpoints for feedback we listened and we heard,12

that links strategy to our execution,3
The roadmap starts with culture signi fying culture is foundational to all we do,8

We start with our Code of Conduct which details the,0
rules we follow and provides a framework for all our,12
decisions and behaviors Updated in 2020 our refreshed,12
Code of Conduct reinforces our commitments to integrity,0
Our rigorous commitment to ethics and integrity is firmly ingrained in our culture and guides our every action,0
each other customers and partners the company and the communities where Rockwell employees live and work,10
In 2021 we provided a comprehensive introduction to our new Code in our Annual Ethics Training which 100 of our Board of Directors employees and contractors completed,0
Typically each years training focuses on several topics,2
within the Code but for 2021 we reviewed each of the Codes,12
nearly two dozen sections including workplace safety,9
diversity and inclusion and anticorruption and bribery,8
Also last year we significantly expanded the reach and,12
content of our workplace harassment training For the first,8
time in 2021 we required each of our 2969 global people,10
of our Board of Directors employees and contractors completed Annual Ethics Training,0
managers to complete the scenariobased training that now,8
includes all forms of harassment and can be customized to,8
Ethics and integrity are among our highest scoring drivers,0
of employee engagement nurtured and cultivated through a,8
strong speak up mindset A hallmark of that mindset is our,0
independent Ombuds program that reports directly to the,12
Audit Committee of our Board of Directors,7
Since 1985 our Ombuds has become a trusted resource,0
for colleagues and others to seek advice share concerns,12
and report allegations of wrongdoing and possible Code of,0
Conduct violations We were one of the first US companies,0
to form an Ombuds office which now includes regional,12
Ombuds in Latin America the Europe Middle East and,12
Africa region and Asia Pacific,3
During 2021 the Ombuds received 490 contacts consistent,12
with the annual range of between 400 and 500 contacts for,12
the past five years At 34 our anonymous contact rate is significantly lower than the global benchmark of 58,0
reflecting a high degree of trust from our employees As,0
typical of other global companies North America represents,18
the highest percentage of Ombuds contacts However our,0
contacts from outside of North America grew to 42 last,3

The office of the Ombuds performed more than 100 investi,12

Marcelo Tarkieltaub regional director Southeast Asia hired someone he,3

of behavior that violated our Code of Conduct he reported the behavior and,0
stepped aside to ensure our Ombuds office could conduct a fair and impartial,12
investigation When those violations were confirmed and substantiated,0
Marcelo supported the separation of his recent hire,8
Stefano Canninah and Marcelo all reflect why we have earned a valued,0
reputation for integrity We work hard to meet business goals but never at,0
