At Travelers we manage risk for our customers and for over 160 years theyve trusted,18
us to be there when it matters most In 2021 despite the ongoing challenges of the,12
global pandemic we continued to deliver the risk management products and services,15
our customers need to live their lives and run their businesses Our years of experience,15
prepared us for this moment and were building upon that foundation to sustain our,3
Our continued success requires that we do three things successfully perform transform and make good on the Travelers Promise,3
At Travelers perform is the flywheel that sets everything we do in motion Perform for us means executing on our longterm financial strategy to generate industryleading,3
returns on equity over time In each of the past 10 years we have outperformed,18
the industry in terms of average return on equity and as a consequence in creating,18
shareholder value By continuing to execute successfully on our longterm financial,4
strategy we will continue to outperform and create shareholder value,3
Our formidable competitive advantages are the foundation of our success However we understand that the competitive advantages that,4
have fueled our achievements over the past decade will not necessarily be the same as those we will need to continue to lead for the next decade Consequently transform means positioning the company to continue to perform by ensuring that our competitive advantages remain relevant and differentiating tomorrow and 10 years from tomorrow To that end we have embraced an ambitious innovation agenda guided by our vision to be the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers,4
Perform is how we deliver industryleading results today and transform is the way we prepare to do so tomorrow Each depends on the other and both depend on one thing the Travelers Promise,4
The Travelers Promise is a commitment to take care of our customers our communities and each other This includes being there to,10
help our customers recover after the storm and also giving them the security they need to invest in their families and businesses It,13
also includes caring for the communities in which we live and work by supporting academic and career success and promoting the,2
development of thriving neighborhoods and enriched communities Finally it is about making Travelers a great place to work for our,8
diverse workforcethe best talent in the industryand a great partner for our agents and brokers In the end the Travelers Promise is,8
about taking care of the people we are privileged to serve,10
Put another way for Travelers sustainability comes down to this Only by successfully delivering on our perform and transform agenda,3
will we earn the resources we need to keep the Travelers Promise And only by faithfully keeping the Travelers Promise will we earn the,10
support of key stakeholders essential to our perform and transform success That is how we are going to deliver results next quarter and,3
succeed for the next quarter century,18
With that in mind I invite you to read on about the ways we are driving sustainability at Travelers,3

At Travelers our simple and unwavering mission for creating shareholder value is to deliver superior returns on equity by leveraging our competitive advantages generate earnings and capital substantially in excess of our growth needs and thoughtfully rightsize capital and grow book value per share over time Our Board of Directors regularly reviews this longterm financial strategy Executing our longterm strategy requires that we fulfill our promise to take care of our customers our communities and our employees By executing our financial strategy investing strategically in the future and delivering on the Travelers Promise we will continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time,3
Our LongTerm Financial Strategy for Creating Shareholder Value,3
More than a decade ago Travelers laid out a clear simple and unwavering mission for creating shareholder value,3
Our results in achieving the elements of this longterm financial strategy speak for themselves Over the past decade,3
y Our return on equity has significantly outperformed the average return on equity for the industry,18
y We returned more than 28 billion of excess capital to our shareholders,12
y We grew dividends per share at an average annual rate of 8,18
y We have grown book value per share and adjusted book value per share at a compound annual rate of 7,18
Importantly over this 10year period our return on equity has been less volatile than that of others in the property and casualty,18
industry The level and consistency of our return on equity over time reflect the value of our competitive advantages and demonstrate,4
the discipline with which we run our business,0
Delivering IndustryLeading Return on Equity Over Time,4
The results we deliver are due to our deliberate and consistent approach to creating shareholder value We have been clear for many,3
years that one of our crucial responsibilities is to produce an appropriate return on equity for our shareholders This has meant,4
developing and executing financial and operational plans consistent with our goal of achieving superior returns which we defined many years ago as a midteens core return on equity over time We emphasize that the objective is measured over time because we recognize that the macroeconomic environment loss cost trends weather and geopolitical and other factors impact our results from year to,3
year and that there are yearsor longer periodsand environments in which a midteens return is not attainable In that regard we,12
established the midteens goal at a time when the 10year Treasury was yielding around 5 and midteens was simply the quantification,4
of what qualified as an industryleading return in that environment Our ability to achieve a midteens return over time going forward,18
will depend on interest rates returning to more normal levels by historical standards In any event we will always seek to deliver industry,12
Our focus on core return on equity encompasses multiple performance objectives key to creating shareholder value The measure is,3
a function of both core income and shareholders equity excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments Accordingly core,18
return on equity reflects a number of separate areas of financial performance related to both our income statement and balance sheet,18
including the quality and profitability of our underwriting and investment decisions the pricing of our policies the effectiveness of our,12
claims management and the efficacy of our capital and risk management,18
One critical component of our ability to deliver exceptional returns over time is our granular approach to underwriting In our,4
commercial businesses that means execution including the allocation of capital on an accountbyaccount or classbyclass basis In,4
personal lines that means a very high degree of account segmentation and the allocation of capital generally by product and geography,4
With that and our advanced data and analytics we select the risks we write and price our products deliberately with our targeted return,15
in mind Underlying all of this is a culture that understands how to balance the art and science of decisionmaking based on data and,12
analytics This culture alone is a competitive advantage and one that we believe is hard to replicate Our underwriting expertise is a,4
hallmark of our success and evaluating risk and reward is at the heart of what we do,3
We actively manage all levers of profitability available to us including risk selection mix of business claim and expense initiatives,18
volume reinsurance terms and conditions and price We have a long track record of capitalizing on all of the available levers to deliver,4
superior returnsand of applying these levers on a strategic and businessbybusiness basis This is evident in the way we have executed,4
quite differently in each of our business segments through changing economic and business cycles,3
Much like our underwriting strategy successfully balancing risk and reward is at the heart of our welldefined investment philosophy Our investment portfolio is managed first and foremost to support our insurance operations and accordingly is positioned to meet our,3
obligations to policyholders under a wide range of conditions With this in mind we emphasize riskadjusted returns and credit quality,18
rather than reaching for yield that is not consistent with the underlying risk Our asset allocation is designed so that the predictable stream,18
of investment income from our fixed income portfolio will provide a firm and reliable foundation for our overall results In addition our,4
Investment Policy approved by our Board of Directors reflects a longterm approach to sustainable value creation and requires that Travelers consider environmental social and governance ESG factors in the investment process to the extent relevant,3
A Balanced Approach to Rightsizing Capital,4
Our capital management strategy has been an important driver of shareholder value creation over time Our first objective for the capital we generate is to reinvest it in our businessorganically and inorganicallyto create shareholder value For example as we,3
continue to grow our premium volumes as we have for the past few years we will retain more capital to support that growth Also,18
we continue to invest in everything from talent to technology to further our ambitious innovation agenda and advance our strategic,8
objectives Having said that we are disciplined stewards of our shareholders capital To the extent that we continue to generate capital,3
that we cannot reinvest consistent with our objective of generating industryleading returns over time we will manage it the same way,18
we have for more than a decadeby returning it to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases By returning excess,18
capital to our investors we give them the ability to allocate their investment dollars as they see fit including by investing in companies,4
with different growth profiles or capital needs thereby efficiently allocating capital across the economy Over time that efficient,18
allocation of capital in the marketplace contributes to a stronger economy,4
The lens through which we evaluate acquisition opportunities is that a transaction should contribute to our mission by improving our,3
longterm return profile reducing the volatility of our returns or creating shareholder value through some other important strategic,18
benefit such as a geographic or product position,4
We have a great deal of experience in executing strategic transactions and we view this as a core competency The company that we are,4
today has come together through a number of significant transactions over the past two decades,18
Across all of our businesses our strategic focus continues to include creating opportunities to write more business through retaining,3
and growing our relationships with our highquality inforce accounts and bringing our franchise value to new customers As we have,0
done successfully over the past few years we will continue to seek to grow without compromising our return objectives or changing,3
our risk profile primarily by targeting customers industries products and geographies that we know well In terms of geography we,18
continue to believe that geopolitical risk and economic instability around the world are underappreciated Accordingly we like our,18
North America concentration That is not to say that we do not continue to recognize value and evaluate opportunities outside of North,18
America but we have set an even higher bar for those opportunities today,4
Our competitive advantages set us apart they are foundational to the success of our longterm financial strategy At the same time we understand clearly that the world is changing and changing quickly Broadly speaking we see four significant forces of change impacting,4
y Consumers expectations are changing and being shaped by their experiences in other industries,4
y Rapid progress in technology is enabling us to reimagine almost every aspect of our business,3
y The opportunities presented by data and analytics are becoming even more consequential,18
y Traditional distribution is consolidating and alternative models are developing,4
We are focused intently on these forces of change While our longterm financial strategy is not changing the competitive advantages,4
that have fueled our success over the last decade will not necessarily be the same as those we will need to continue to lead for the next,3
decade That is the focus of our innovation agenda making sure that our competitive advantages are as relevant and differentiating,4
tomorrow as they are today,3
Ultimately the vision for our innovation agenda is to be,3
the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers,4
This vision drives our three innovation priorities,15
y Extending our advantage in risk expertise,18
y Providing great experiences for our customers agents and brokers and employees,4
y Optimizing our productivity and efficiency,24
A key theme running through our investments is that they are designed in large part to enable us to optimize the top line at attractive,3
returns We have been investing in these priorities for several years while delivering industryleading returns and an improving expense ratio,18
We are undertaking this work from a position of strength We have the resources and expertise to be successful Moreover our business,3
is complex and the value of deep domain expertise in understanding risk and the products and services our customers need to manage,15
that risk cannot be underestimated as the starting point for innovation We believe the winners in our industry will be those who can,18
innovate successfully on top of a foundation of excellence,3
Underlying our financial strategy and our innovation agenda is the Travelers Promiseour promise to be there for our customers communities,3
and employees Only by faithfully keeping the Travelers Promise will we earn the support of key stakeholders essential to our success And,10
only by successfully delivering on our financial strategy and executing our innovation agenda will we earn the resources we need to keep the,3
Travelers Promise Thats why at Travelers our business strategy and performance are inextricably linked with the Travelers Promise,3
Our Competitive Advantages Are Meaningful Sustainable,4
Our competitive advantages serve as the foundation of our financial success and help us fulfill our promise to protect our customers,4
Underlying our competitive advantages are four key enablers that help set us apartour talent and expertise industryleading data and,4
analytics technology and financial strength,18
RISK SELECTION UNDERWRITING PRICING SEGMENTATION,4
Data and analytics influence the decisions we make and drive innovation throughout the organizationfrom the development and,3

tools and enhance our training and recruitment practices with the goal of ensuring that our expertise in data and analytics stays at the,8
cutting edge In addition we are increasingly transforming our data into actionable insights to improve our decisionmaking,4

At Travelers our Enterprise Risk Management ERM activities involve both the identification and assessment of a broad range of risks and the execution of coordinated strategies to effectively manage these risks The mission of our ERM group is to facilitate risk assessment and collaborate in implementing effective risk management strategies to optimize risk and return in alignment with our goals and values,18
ERM at Travelers is an integral part of our business operations The standards and practices we employ to evaluate and monitor risks,0
are designed to enable a consistent approach to risk management across the organization We manage our risktaking to be within our,18
risk appetite in a prudent and balanced manner to create and preserve value for all of the companys stakeholders ERM also includes,18
an evaluation of the companys risk capital needs which takes into account regulatory requirements financial strength and credit rating,12
considerations among economic and other factors,12
A senior executive team which includes the companys Chief Risk Officer and Chief Underwriting Officer oversees the ERM process,3
This team facilitates risk assessments and collaborates with others throughout the enterprise including risk owners across the organization and senior leaders to implement effective risk management strategies for Travelers In addition our ERM group,18
collaborates with the companys Chief Sustainability Officer to ensure that identification and assessment of environmental social and,10
governance ESG risks are appropriately integrated into our ERM framework The ERM group also uses thirdparty modeling processes,18
to evaluate capital adequacy These analytical techniques are an integral component of the companys ERM process and further support,3
the companys longterm financial strategies and objectives,3
The diagram below illustrates some of the different groups committees functions and processes involved in our comprehensive,12
approach to overseeing and managing risk,18
Our Board of Directors oversees our ERM process As illustrated in the graphic above the Risk Committee and other committees of the,7
Board are an essential part of our ERM framework and help to establish and reinforce our strong culture of risk management,18
The Risk Committee of the Board meets with senior management at least four times a year to discuss ERM activities and provides,7
a report to the full Board of Directors after each such meeting This approach enables a high degree of coordination between,7
The Board Risk Committee oversees the implementation execution and performance of the Travelers ERM program and reviews the,12
strategies processes and controls pertaining to Travelers insurance operations The Board also allocates and delegates risk oversight,12
responsibility to various committees of the Board Accordingly all committees of the Board share responsibility for oversight of,7
strategic objectives risk management and the sustainability of our business We believe that allocating responsibility for specific risks to,18
a committee with a particular skill set improves the effectiveness of the overall oversight of risks and opportunities The Board reviews,12
and acknowledges these responsibilities annually,12
The Board has allocated and delegated risk oversight responsibility to various committees of the Board as follows,12
Responsible for oversight of risks related to the integrity of financial statements,0
including oversight of financial reporting principles and policies and internal controls,0
the process for establishing insurance reserves and risks related to regulatory and compliance matters generally Audit Committee Charter,12
Responsible for oversight of risks related to compensation programs including,0

manage its portfolio of risks to be within its risk appetite and tolerance,18
y Allocates economic capital to our products and businesses and helps ensure capital efficiency in concert with regulatory and rating,12
In addition our ERM group leads the companys annual Management Identification of Significant Risks MISRa governance process,18
through which senior risk and business leaders and various committees collaborate to identify the significant inherent and residual risks,18
faced by Travelers The MISR process assigns management responsibility for individual risks to senior corporate leaders andor internal,18
groups committees and processes and assigns oversight responsibility to various Board Committees The MISR is reviewed with our,12
Board Risk and Audit Committees at least annually and is also reviewed by the Board as part of its annual review of the allocation of risk,12
As part of our ERM process we use metrics and riskreward analytics to actively evaluate and adjust our strategies as well as to,18
further support our longterm financial strategy and business objectives For example we use various analyses and methods including,3
proprietary and thirdparty computer modeling processes to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage the,4
companys exposure to catastrophic events In addition to catastrophe modeling and analysis we model and analyze our exposure to,13
other extreme events We also utilize proprietary and thirdparty computer modeling processes to evaluate capital adequacy,4
Our approach to ERM is reinforced by our compensation structure which is designed to encourage a careful balance of risk and,18
reward both on an individual risk basis and on a companywide basis Our compensation program also promotes and drives a longterm,0
perspective to managing our business This longterm perspective is especially important in the property casualty insurance industry,3
where a shortterm focus could create incentives for management to relax the companys underwriting or investment standards to,12
increase revenue and reported profit in the near term but could create excessive risk for shareholders over the longer term Moreover,3
results in the property casualty insurance industry can vary significantly when measured year to year because of a variety of factors,18
including the periodic occurrence of significant catastrophes Accordingly we believe that the right way to manage our business is with a longterm perspective with an eye toward creating value over time See our Proxy Statement for a comprehensive discussion of how our compensation program incorporates this longterm perspective,18
Our approach to business resiliency is designed to allow us to deliver on the Travelers Promise to,3
take care of our customers communities and employees in the face of unexpected disruptions,18
Travelers Business Resiliency Program is our internal ecosystem focused on the goal of ensuring,3
that we can operate consistently for our employees agents and customers despite crises and,0
operational disruptions and accordingly continue to deliver for our shareholders Our Business,5
Resiliency Program takes a holistic threepronged approach that encompasses business continuity disaster recovery and crisis,5
management With support from senior management and with oversight by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors our program,7
focuses on both preventive measures including technology availability design facility resilience and trainingawareness programs and,3
response preparation including business contingency planning technology restoration and crisis managementemergency response,5
The Travelers Business Resiliency Risk Committee composed of members of our executive team oversees the implementation of our,3
Business Resiliency Program and along with our managementlevel Enterprise Risk Committee is charged with reviewing and approving,3
mission and businesscritical processes identifying risks to business resiliency and facilitating decisions to accept mitigate or remediate,3
Pursuant to its charter the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the strategies processes and controls pertaining to,7
business continuity and executive crisis management for the Company and its business operations In exercising its oversight the Risk,5
Committee of our Board meets annually with members of the Business Resiliency Risk Committee and the Enterprise Risk Committee,3
to review the companys business continuity disaster recovery and crisis management efforts Among other things the Risk Committee,5
reviews the enterprise event response protocols discusses how those protocols would be and were triggered for events ranging from,5
catastrophes to local shootings to bomb threats and evaluates lessons learned from actual events such as the COVID19 pandemic,5
The Risk Committee also receives quarterly reports regarding preventive measures relating to cyber incidents including those events,1
affecting suppliers that may impact Travelers In addition the Risk Committee is regularly briefed on the steps taken to reduce future risk,17
and improve our threat detection and response processes,1
The primary objective of business continuity is to ensure that the company is prepared to respond to and recover from an unexpected,18
disruption This requires a solid understanding of the risks to our operational structure and involves contingency planning and testing of,18
hundreds of business processes across Travelers We have inventoried our business processes and categorized them according to their,4
criticality and urgency to the company and we have tailored our resiliency measures accordingly,3
Through annual risk reviews which are facilitated centrally each business function updates its resiliency plans with respect to key operational aspects The plans include specific recovery scenarios and detailed workaround plans to be leveraged in the event of a,3
disruption related to technology facility workforce or supplier issues We also conduct validation exercises to test the effectiveness of,17
In addition as a fundamental part of our enterprise supplier management program we identify supplier risks and mitigating controls,17
enabling the company to make informed decisions throughout the life cycle of a supplier relationship Specifically we assess the,17
business continuity and disaster recovery risk of our suppliers to evaluate their overall business resiliency recovery capabilities and,5
limitations And we create contingency plans detailing how the company will continue to operate if a supplier becomes unavailable,17
We base our approach to disaster recovery on a model that provides redundant infrastructure application and platform solutions,5
designed to enable continued operation in the event of a disruption We review these solutions on a regular basis to ensure that they,5
continue to align with our business strategy In addition on an annual basis we perform disaster recovery testing on all of our mission,5
We inventory all computing platforms with a detailed plan to move to an alternate site the specifics of which vary by application design,3
and business criticality We maintain technology availability standards to help ensure adequate designs are deployed and sufficient,12
procedures are in place and tested to restore infrastructure applications and data in the event of a disaster,5
We perform daily backups of production data from our primary facility to our alternate sites Critical technology infrastructure is,1
designed with sufficient levels of redundancy to support recovery from local or geographic service disruption events,18
Our Crisis Management Operating Model includes two teams the Operational Response Team ORT and the Enterprise Event,5
Our integrated ORT comes together to manage events both planned and unplanned providing a coordinated and facilitated response,12
to situations of all types The ORT is a group of employees from across the organization prepared to come together before during or,8
shortly after an event to ensure that we respond appropriately The ORT manages corporate security real estate technology cyber,1
business continuity and environmental health and safety events This team is activated and engaged regardless of the severity of the,9
event The ORT also maintains welldocumented emergency response procedures and conducts regular training scenario planning,5
and exercises in anticipation of potential emergency scenarios Travelers has eventspecific playbooks covering protocols for various,5
scenarios including a pandemic natural disaster data center outage and cybersecurity incident For example our corporate pandemic,5
plan which outlines our strategy for maintaining a safe and healthy workplace while continuing to deliver uninterrupted service to,9
our customers and agent and broker partners was activated when the COVID19 outbreak began Roles and responsibilities of team,3
members are clearly defined enabling an efficient response to a national crisis or a technology worksite workforce or supplier event,17
The EERT manages catastrophe events underwriting and exposure claim response and regulatory events When escalation is required,18
these teams engage with the appropriate group of senior executives tasked with overseeing the execution of our crisis management and,18
emergency response plans related to the event,5
Travelers Business Resiliency Management in the Face of COVID19,3
Despite the extraordinarily challenging circumstances related to COVID19 we were able to continue to serve our customers and our,6
agent and broker partners seamlessly due to our extensive planning and preparation for unforeseeable circumstances the commitment,12
resourcefulness and professionalism of our team and the tremendous efforts of our Technology and Operations group Upon initial,8
reports of the emerging coronavirus in January 2020 we activated our Business Continuity Crisis Management and Disaster Recovery,5
teams to track the outbreak and begin executing our robust business resiliency plans In February 2020 the group expanded to include,3
the Executive Crisis Management team which effectively oversaw and managed the companys response to the rapidly evolving events in,5
Anticipating a scenario where nearly all employees would need to work remotely and necessary Claim professionals would need to,11
safely engage with customers our Operational Response Team acted quickly to limit business disruption and maintain the security of,5
information As part of those efforts we assessed risk and risk mitigation levers on hundreds of business processes while activating and,18
developing plans to assess and further strengthen our technology infrastructure and cybersecurity,1
During the first few months of the COVID19 pandemic our Board of Directors met biweekly with our Chief Executive Officer to review,7
managements operational response to the pandemic as well as strategies to mitigate the short and longterm risks to the company,13

our entire workforce practically overnight to safely and effectively work from home all while maintaining employee productivity and,11
engagement Our comprehensive planning and ongoing testing as well as the exceptional response of Travelers employees to the crisis,5
enabled us to continue to deliver the risk management products and services that our customers need to live their lives and run their,18
businesses as well as the outstanding uninterrupted service that our customers and agent and broker partners have come to expect,4
Balanced Approach to Capital Management,4
Travelers has consistently provided excellent service to policyholders while delivering strong returns over time Integral to our long,12
term financial strategy is a balanced approach to rightsizing capital and generating capital in excess of our growth needs We maintain,3
operating company capital at levels needed to support our current business profile and growth opportunities consistent with our,3
objective of maintaining significant financial strength and strong credit ratings Specifically our capital models first address our need to,18
comply with regulatory riskbased capital requirements and our desire to,12
y Maintain significant financial strength and strong credit ratings,18
y Continue to remain financially strong after a significant catastrophe event,13
y Ensure that we can satisfy the claim payments and other obligations of our business,12
To meet these objectives we monitor our cash inflows eg premiums service fees investment income and outflows eg claim,18
payments capital investments operating expenses on an ongoing basis Since most of our policies renew annually we regularly,12
reassess our pricing and risk appetite against our capital needs,3
Our capital management strategy has been an important driver of shareholder value creation over time As we have said many times our,3
first objective for the capital we generate is to reinvest itorganically and inorganicallyin our business to create shareholder value We will continue to retain capital to support growth in our business and invest capital to further our ambitious innovation agenda and advance other strategic objectives Today we are making strategic investments in everything from talent to technology Having said that,3
we are disciplined stewards of our shareholders capital and to the extent that we continue to generate capital that we cannot reinvest,3
consistent with our objective of generating industryleading returns over time we will manage it the same way we have for more than a,18
decadeby returning it to our shareholders,12
Our Balanced Approach to Capital Management,3
Over the last 10 years our financial success and balance sheet strength have enabled Travelers to grow dividends per share at an average annual rate of 8 while increasing our book value per share by 92 These accomplishments are on top of returning more than,18
28 billion of excess capital to the companys shareholders over the same 10year period Our financial strength is also reflected in our,3
strong credit ratings from four of the major rating agencies,18
Since the initial share repurchase authorization in May 2006 and through December 31 2021 TRV has returned 498 billion of capital to shareholders 379 billion in share repurchases at average price of 7028 per share and 119 billion in dividends,18
The primary purpose of our investment portfolio is to position us to fulfill our promise to our customers to fund future claim payments For this reason we employ a thoughtful investment philosophy that focuses on stable and appropriate riskadjusted returns,18
We strive to be thoughtful underwriters on both sides of our balance sheet and we have always allocated our assets to support our,12
insurance operations not the reverse Because the primary purpose of our investment portfolio is to fund future claim payments,12
Travelers employs a riskadjusted approach to its investment portfolio Our asset allocation gives us a high level of confidence that our,18
capital is adequate to support our insurance business in both good times and bad Our approach has served us remarkably well over a,18
long period and allows us to invest in our businesses with an eye to the future,3

Committee of the Board oversees our investment strategy and the risks related to our investment portfolio including valuation and,18

WellDefined and Consistent Investment Philosophy,4
Our investment portfolio is a key source of stability and strength for Travelers The portfolio is managed first and foremost to support,18
our insurance operations and accordingly is positioned to meet our obligations to policyholders under almost every foreseeable,12
circumstanceanything from a global pandemic to a significant natural disaster to a financial crisis With this in mind we are focused on,5
riskadjusted returns and credit quality rather than reaching for yield that is not commensurate with the underlying risk,18
Our asset allocation is designed so that the predictable stream of investment income from our fixed income portfolio will provide a firm,12
and reliable foundation for our business In addition the allocation between fixed income and alternative investments is designed such,12
that when the market is challenging for our alternative investment portfolio we still have a shot at reaching our target returns and when,4
the alternative portfolio has a strong year we will benefit from the upside,18
Our performance over the past two years is a perfect illustration of how effective this disciplined investment strategy is in managing,3
through very different and volatile market conditions In 2020 we saw record low interest rates the 10year Treasury hit a stunning,18
low of 0318 and we experienced significant volatility in the equity markets that negatively impacted the returns from our alternative,18
investment portfolio Nonetheless we delivered strong 2020 net investment income of 19 billion aftertax contributing to a strong,18
core return on equity of 113 In 2021 the alternative investment portfolio benefited from the recovery in the equity markets and the,18
same disciplined strategy and wellconstructed portfolio delivered net investment income of 25 billion aftertax contributing to an,18
industryleading core return on equity of 137,4
Strategy not serendipity drove these strong results throughout two very different economic and market environmentsthat is the,4
value of our thoughtful and disciplined approach,10

are the higher of the rating of the underlying insurer or the insurer in the case of securities enhanced by thirdparty insurance for the payment of the principal and interest in the event of issuer default Below investment grade assets refer to securities rated Ba or below,18
As of December 31 2021 Travelers invested assets totaled 874 billion of which 93 was invested in fixed maturity and shortterm,18
investments This highquality investment portfolio generated net investment income of 3 billion pretax in 2021,0
In addition to achieving appropriate riskadjusted returns our investments enable many environmental and social improvements As one of the,10
largest investors in municipal bonds we provide funding to approximately 950 different municipal issuers with the proceeds of our investments,12
used to improve the quality of life in communities across 48 states the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico For example we invest in,9
municipal bonds that support water and sewer projects 6 billion which help mitigate pollution provide safe drinking water promote,20
conservation and in many cases respond to changing climate conditions Additionally our investments in K12 education 108 billion and,13
higher education 5 billion support enterprises directly involved in improving communities and students lives We currently own almost 24,2
billion in fixed income securities classified as green bonds by Bloomberg We also maintain smaller investments in lowincome housing tax credits which help build affordable housing See the Investment Portfolio section in our Form 10K for a detailed breakdown of our investment portfolio For additional detailed information related to our investment holdings please see our most recent annual audited statutory basis financial statements for the Travelers Combined Pool and other nonpooled entities A summary of the investments held by investment type country and credit rating where applicable can be found in the Summary Investment Schedule Exhibit 2 for the Travelers Combined,12

ESG Factors in Investment Decisions,3
We recognize the importance of responsible investment and accordingly incorporate environmental social and governance ESG,10
factors in assessing the sustainability of the entities in which we invest We have traditionally limited our exposure to public equity,18
securities and other riskier asset classes Since we invest overwhelmingly in fixed income securities our analysis of ESG factors focuses,18
primarily on credit risk Our Investment Policy approved by our Board of Directors reflects a longterm approach to sustainable value,3
creation and requires Travelers consideration of ESG factors in the investment process to the extent relevant,3
With respect to our fixed income investments we invest using a variety of qualitative and quantitative criteria that take into account,12
both expected returns and risks including interest rate credit and prepayment risks Our fundamental investment process weighs on an,18
appropriate basis financial statement data management information relevant ESG factors thirdparty research and other information,22
In addition our asset allocation process considers the expected return advantages offered in the market in compensation for bearing,4
various risks including credit risk and ESG risks,18
We have assigned internally developed ESG scores to all issuers in our fixed income portfolio In certain circumstances this process has,18
led to the exclusion of potential investments or the divestment of portfolio holdings negative screening due to ESG risks where we,18
believed that the expected returns were not consistent with the underlying risksin other words where we did not believe we would be,18
appropriately compensated for the risks that we would be assuming,18
Consistent with our creditbased approach to investing we have also recently announced a public commitment to avoid making new debt or equity investments in companies with significant exposure to thermal coal mining tar sands or coalbased electricity generation,12
In addition in our municipal bond mortgage and real estate investments we consider the impact that changing climate conditions may,13
have on any given city state or region Since we assume catastrophe risks such as earthquakes and windstorms in our capacity as an,13
insurer we also seek to manage our portfolios credit risk to such events by assessing our investment exposures in impacted geographic,18
areas In addition for municipal bond issuers in the Southwestern United States and other areas of the country susceptible to drought,13
all investment analyses include an assessment of water supply adequacy,20
For further discussion on the incorporation of ESG factors in our investment process and the impact of the regulatory environment in which we operate on the investments we make please see our SASB disclosure,12
As independent Lead Director of Travelers I am privileged to serve a company that,7
helps its customers achieve their personal and business goals by protecting the things,10
that matter most to them I am also proud to oversee a management team that takes an,7
integrated approach to sustained value creation,3
As a Board we have a responsibilityjust as management doesto act as stewards of our shareholders capital by creating shareholder value over time I emphasize over time because in the property and casualty insurance business decisions are made and strategies are developed based on tens and even hundreds of years of data At Travelers,3
weve observed that the companies that create the most shareholder value are the ones,4
that think not quarterbyquarter but decadebydecade as our company does In that,4
sense Travelers has been managing with a mindset focused on sustainability long before,15
As Alan notes in his message management has also long recognized that to succeed in its mission of creating shareholder value over time the company must not only perform and transform but also take care of its customers communities and employeesor as we refer to it fulfill the Travelers Promise The Board agreesthe companys mission of creating shareholder value is inextricably linked with upholding the Travelers Promise In fact Travelers success for over 160 years is owed in large part to keeping that Promise,3
Our Board takes a holistic approach to its oversight responsibilities with the goal of ensuring that the decisions Travelers makes today,7
maximize its longterm sustainability Working closely with Travelers leadership the Board provides oversight of the companys business,7
In addition to overseeing capital allocation investment management enterprise risk management and other business topics traditionally,3
overseen by boards the Board meets regularly with senior Travelers leaders to review strategic plans and initiatives related to a broad,7
variety of businessrelevant risks and opportunities These include for example risks and opportunities related to changing climate,13
conditions data privacy and cybersecurity ethics and compliance human capital management diversity and inclusion and community,8
relations to name just a few Recognizing the importance of a strong company culture our discussions include a focus on how the,3
company is fostering a culture of candor and respect at every level of the organization,0
In 2021 the Board continued to review the ongoing impacts of the global pandemic including its impact on our employees As part of,13
a larger strategic planning session we reviewed strategies related to the companys human capital management efforts including talent,8
management and the employee experience diversity and inclusion and the future of work Additionally this last year as we have done in,8
the past the Risk Committee and the Board met regularly with leaders throughout the organization including the Chief Risk Officer the,7
Chief Underwriting Officer and the SVP for Catastrophe Risk Management to discuss catastrophe risks including weather volatility and,18
Among other things these discussions focused on Travelers underwriting risk management approach in light of catastrophe volatility,18
the potential impact of climaterelated perils to Travelers and its customers and strategies for mitigating climaterelated risks,13
In 2021 technology and cybersecurity risks continued to be top of mind for the Board and for me as Chair of the Risk Committee The,18
Risk Committee and the Board met regularly with the Chief Technology and Operations Officer the Chief Information Security Officer,1
and other senior leaders to review evolving cyber risks and their impact on our company our cyber products and our customers,1
In addition over the past year we reviewed how Travelers technology continues to support innovation in our businesses and drive,15
improvements in our customer experience,15
We recognize that given the pace of change in todays world our business will continue to face new and evolving challenges As a,3
Board we will continue to examine each issue with the attention and thoughtfulness it deserves with the overarching goal of ensuring,12
Travelers ability to create shareholder value over time We feel confident that this approach will enable Travelers to continue to perform,4
today and transform for tomorrow,3
On behalf of the Travelers Board I look forward to continuing to serve the interests of our shareholders and other stakeholders In the,7
meantime I encourage you to read more about Travelers holistic approach to sustained value creation on this site,3
Todd C Schermerhorn Lead Director,7
The Board of Directors and management of Travelers are committed to implementing sound corporate governance practices with the goal of ensuring that the company operates ethically and with integrity and is managed to maximize the longterm interests of its shareholders,0
Our commitment to good corporate governance is reflected in our Governance Guidelines which describe the Boards views on a wide range of governance topics These Governance Guidelines are reviewed annually by the Nominating and Governance Committee and any changes deemed appropriate are submitted to the full Board for its consideration Our 2022 Proxy Statement discusses our robust corporate governance practices which are designed to support sustained value creation for our shareholders,12
The Board works with management to set the shortterm and longterm strategic objectives of our company and to monitor progress,3
on those objectives Strategic topics are generally discussed at each Board meeting and the Board and management participate in a,7
separate strategy session each year In setting and monitoring strategy the Board along with management considers the risks and,18
opportunities that impact the longterm sustainability of our business model and whether the strategy is consistent with our core values culture and risk appetite The Board regularly reviews,3
y Our progress with respect to our strategic goals,3
y The risks including the environmental social and governance ESG risks that could impact the longterm sustainability of our business,3
y The related opportunities that could enhance our longterm sustainability,3
The Board oversees these efforts in part through its standing committees based on each committees responsibilities and areas of,12
expertise Each committee regularly reports to the Board regarding its areas of responsibility The Board has allocated and delegated risk,12
oversight responsibility to its committees in accordance with the following principles,12
y Risks related to the integrity of financial statements including oversight of financial,0
reporting principles and policies and internal controls,0
y The companys process for establishing insurance reserves,12
y Risks related to regulatory and compliance matters,12
y The companys Enterprise Risk Management activities,18
y Risks related to business operations including insurance underwriting and claims,18
reinsurance catastrophe risk and the impact of changing climate conditions credit risk,13
in insurance operations and information technology including cybersecurity,1
y The companys business continuity plans,3
y The companys payforperformance philosophy and practices designed to ensure,4
equitable pay across the organization,11
y Risks related to compensation programs including formulation administration and,12
regulatory compliance with respect to compensation matters,12
y Investment portfolio risks including valuation and credit risks capital structure,18
y Risks related to corporate governance matters including succession planning director,18
independence and related person transactions,4
y Workforce diversity and inclusion efforts public policy initiatives and community,8
Each committee is also responsible for monitoring reputational risk to the extent arising out of its area of responsibility,18
Each Board committee has a written charter which contains specific responsibilities including the abovementioned risk oversight functions,7
With respect to oversight of ESGrelated risks and opportunities each committee is assigned responsibility for oversight of matters,18
most applicable to its charter responsibilities We believe that allocating responsibility to a committee with relevant knowledge and,12
experience improves the effectiveness of the Boards oversight For example as indicated above the Audit Committee oversees risks,12
related to regulatory and compliance matters the Compensation Committee oversees implementation of our payforperformance,12
philosophy and practices designed to ensure equitable pay across the organization the Nominating and Governance Committee,11
oversees our workforce diversity and inclusion efforts public policy initiatives and community relations and the Risk Committee,8
oversees strategies pertaining to management of catastrophe exposure changing climate conditions and information technology,13
With a focus on continually improving the ability of the Board to provide informed oversight the Nominating and Governance,12
Committee oversees educational sessions for directors on matters relevant to our company business strategy and risk profile For,3
example topics of those sessions have focused on the role that corporate culture and board oversight played in publicized lapses in,0
corporate governance at other firms,4
The Board and each of its committees evaluate and discuss the allocation of oversight responsibility every year along with their,12
In addition our Chief Sustainability Officer and our ESG management committeea multidisciplinary committee consisting of senior,3
company executives that meets at least quarterlydrive the prioritization and management of and reporting on sustainability issues,3
We also regularly engage with our investors our customers our employees our agents and brokers regulators rating agencies and,12
other stakeholders on business issues and the ESG topics of interest to them,3

An effective and independent Board of Directors is critical to good corporate governance All of our directors other than our Chairman,7
and CEO are independent All committees are comprised of independent directors other than the Executive Committee on which our,7
The Board has an independent Lead Director The independent Lead Director coordinates the efforts of the independent directors and has the authority to among other things convene and chair meetings of the independent directors as deemed necessary as well as to,7
approve the Board meeting schedules and meeting agenda items,7
To further ensure effective independent oversight independent members of the Board regularly meet in executive session with no,7
members of management present Executive sessions are chaired by the independent Lead Director Each of the committees also meets,7
regularly in executive session For additional information on our Board structure and the role of the independent Lead Director see our Governance Guidelines and our Proxy Statement,7
The members of the Board have a broad range of skills expertise industry knowledge viewpoints and backgrounds and include five,8
women and two raciallyethnically diverse directors The Board and the Nominating and Governance Committee carefully consider the,8
importance of diverse viewpoints backgrounds and experiences and other demographics when selecting future director nominees,8
The Board seeks to ensure that it is composed of members whose particular expertise qualifications attributes and skills when taken,8
together allow the Board to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively,12
Another factor considered in board composition is maintaining a balanced approach to board tenure and age with the intent of ensuring,7
an appropriate mix of longserving and new directors Our Governance Guidelines contain a director age limit providing that no person,7
who will have reached the age of 74 before the annual shareholders meeting will be nominated for election at that meeting without an,7
express waiver by the Board The Board believes that waivers of this policy should not be automatic and should be based upon the needs,12
of the company and the individual attributes of the director,7
Our director and executive compensation programs are designed to reinforce a longterm perspective and to align the longterm,7
interests of our executives and directors with those of our shareholders,7
y Under the director compensation program nonmanagement directors currently receive more than 50 of their annual board and,7
committee chair compensation in the form of deferred stock units The shares underlying these units are not distributed to a director,12
until at least six months after the director leaves the Board aligning director interests with those of longterm shareholders,7
y Nonmanagement directors are required to accumulate and retain a level of ownership of Travelers equity securities equal to four,18
times the directors most recent annual deferred stock award,12
y The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews the appropriateness of the director compensation program at least once,7
With our payforperformance philosophy and compensation objectives as our guiding principles we deliver annual executive,11
compensation through the following elements,11
Base salaries are appropriately aligned with,11
The Compensation Committee evaluates a broad,12
range of financial and nonfinancial metrics in,18
Core return on equity is a principal factor in the,18
Compensation Committees evaluation of the,12
The Committee also considers other metrics including,12
core income and core income per diluted share and,18
the metrics that contribute to those results,12
Annual awards of stockbased compensation,0
are typically in the form of stock options and,4
performance shares Because our performance,4
shares only vest if specified core return on equity,4
thresholds are met and because stock options,4
provide value only if our stock price appreciates,4
the Compensation Committee believes that such,12
compensation is all performance based,0
The mix of longterm incentives for the CEO and,12
other named executive officers is approximately,7
60 performance shares and 40 stock options,4
based on the grant date fair value of the awards,12
y Our executive compensation program links compensation to the achievement of our shortterm and longterm financial goals and,11
y As part of our longstanding payforperformance philosophy we utilize performance measures that are intended to align,11
compensation with the creation of shareholder value and reinforce a longterm perspective,12
y The Compensation Committee believes that the most senior executives who are responsible for the development and execution of our strategic and financial plans should have the largest portion of their compensation tied to performancebased incentives,7
including stockbased compensation the ultimate value of which is dependent on the performance of our stock price over time and,4
our threeyear core return on equity Accordingly the proportion of total compensation that is performance based increases with,11
successively higher levels of responsibility,12
y Our executive compensation program reflects established and evolving corporate governance standards including,0
y A robust share ownership requirement of the lesser of 150000 shares or the equivalent value of five times base salary for the CEO the lesser of 30000 shares or the equivalent value of three times base salary for vice chairmen and executive vice,7
presidents and the lesser of 5000 shares or the equivalent of base salary for senior vice presidents,7
y A clawback policy with respect to cash and equity incentive awards to our executive officers,0
y The prohibition of hedging transactions as specified in our securities trading policy,12
y The prohibition of pledging shares without the consent of Travelers no pledges have been made,12
y The Compensation Committee did not modify the terms of outstanding compensation awards or otherwise modify our,11
compensation program or practices due to factors related to the COVID19 pandemic,8
For more detail regarding our executive compensation program see the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of our Proxy Statement,11
Travelers Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws together with our Governance Guidelines define and protect our shareholders rights including through,12
y Annually Elected Directors The annual election of directors reinforces the Boards accountability to shareholders,7
y Proxy Access Shareholders may include director nominees in our Proxy Statement if certain conditions are met,7
y Majority Vote Standard for Director Elections In uncontested elections a director who receives fewer votes For election than,4
Against must promptly tender a resignation to the Board,7
y Single Voting Class Travelers common stock is the only class of shares outstanding,4
y No Poison Pill Travelers does not have a poison pill plan,16

Our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes in each of the geographies where we write business and to varying peak catastrophe perils in different countries and regions Severe weather events over the last two decades have underscored the unpredictability of climate trends and changing climate conditions have added to the frequency and severity of natural disasters and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures Our approach to climaterelated risks and opportunities is multifaceted and we believe it allows us to mitigate our exposure to climaterelated risk and provide products and services that both help our customers mitigate those risks and meet our longterm financial objectives As part of our comprehensive climate strategy we also advocate for and support community resiliency efforts,13
As a core part of our business we continually monitor assess and respond to the risks and opportunities posed by changing climate,13
conditions to provide products and services that both help our customers mitigate associated risks and are priced to meet our long term financial objectives We also regularly consider new insurance products and services that could be useful to our customers in,15
addressing climaterelated risks This section introduces our approach to managing changing climate conditions which we expand on in a detailed report that aligns with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures TCFD To read about environmental efforts within our operations refer to the EcoEfficient Operations section,13
Our Board of Directors and its Risk Committee consider changing climate conditions as part of and integral to overseeing our business,13
and operations The Board of Directors plays an important role in overseeing our Enterprise Risk Management ERM practices and,7

The Risk Committee meets on a quarterly basis with the Chief Risk Officer Chief Underwriting Officer members of the Enterprise Risk,7
Committee and as appropriate other members of senior management to discuss risks that could have a material impact on Travelers,18
including risks relating to changing climate conditions These discussions include for example information regarding historical loss,13

These discussions inform among other things the companys financial plan risk appetite and underwriting approach The Risk,18
Committee in turn reports to the full Board with regard to its discussions,7
In addition to the Risk Committee our managementlevel enterprise risk and underwriting risk committees are key elements of our ERM,18
structure and help establish and reinforce our strong culture of risk management including with respect to changing climate conditions,13
A senior executive team which includes the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Underwriting Officer oversees the ERM process We also,3
have other businesslevel risk committees that meet multiple times a year with senior management to discuss potential risks to Travelers,18
related to the environment and changing climate conditions These committees include the Enterprise Risk Committee the Enterprise,13
Catastrophe Committee the Emerging Issues Committee and the Climate Energy and the Environment Committee CEEC,13
The CEEC coordinates and supports climaterelated initiatives and strategies across Travelers and is a venue to share information and,13

began accepting a TCFD Report in lieu of a completed NAIC survey in 2020 Readers are encouraged to review our TCFD Report to gain,12
a more complete understanding of our approach to addressing the risks and opportunities related to changing climate conditions,13
The Risk Identification and Management Subcommittee of our Climate Energy and the Environment Committee CEEC meets regularly,13
to discuss and assess climaterelated issues risks and trends The subcommittee stays current on climaterelated and environmental,13
risks including through industry publications and external conferences and actively monitors various relevant factors such as,18
y Climaterelated litigation and novel theories of liability,0
y Legal and regulatory requirements impacting climate energy and the environment,12
y Marketbased policies that put a price on greenhouse gases such as carbon pricing or capandtrade programs,25
y Efforts by states nations and nongovernmental organizations to adopt policies or implement programs designed to reduce,12
y Emerging regulatory requirements and best practice guides for international businesses with respect to risk management,12
disclosure and scenario analysis practices relating to changing climate conditions,13
y Impacts related to emerging clean or green energy and technology trends and products,15
The subcommittee also receives regular updates from internal subject matter experts regarding emerging scientific analyses and,12
published reports relating to weather trends and the effects of changing climate conditions The majority of these publications focus on,13
forwardlooking impacts of changing climate conditions These publications include,13
y Materials issued by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,13
y National Climate Assessment Reports issued in the United States by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as part,13
of the US Global Change Research Program,3
y Articles published in scientific journals,12
When a potential risk is identified the subcommittee engages in a comprehensive review to evaluate the risk This process involves the,18
relevant internal stakeholder groups and as appropriate may be elevated under our Enterprise Risk Management ERM framework for discussion with senior management and the Board of Directors To read more about our ERM activities refer to the Capital Risk Management section,3
Climate trends which manifest themselves over long periods of time provide a longterm opportunity for our Risk Control department,13
to offer and develop services to help current and potential customers mitigate the risks associated with changing climate conditions,13
For example to help mitigate and minimize property losses caused by weatherrelated events Travelers Risk Control has developed a,18
comprehensive framework of technical planning resources to assist customers with conducting business impact analyses to prioritize,3
and implement risk management action plans and physical improvements Risk Control monitors events and claim trends and partners,18
with associations such as the Insurance Institute for Business Home Safety IBHS to assess innovative building products and new,15
technologies to minimize wind hail flood and wildfire exposures This deep domain expertise allows us to help customers improve their,13
In addition our Risk Control professionals provide guidance to our customers who have incorporated green products or systems to,18
reduce carbon emissions andor increase environmental sustainability These products and systems include for example solar panels on,15
residential and commercial rooftops lithiumion batteries used to store solar energy and vegetative roofs on commercial buildings,24
Travelers Risk Control maintains technical committee memberships on the National Fire Protection Association the Underwriters,5
Laboratories Standards Technical Panels the Fire Protection Research Foundations Property Insurance Research Group the,5
Organization of Scientific Area Committees for Forensic Science Standards and other associations to help us research and evaluate,12
the reliability and fire safety of green products and systems to determine how these products and systems impact fire structural,15
and safety exposures This knowledge is used to continually update our views and empowers our Risk Control professionals to help,14
our customers mitigate the risks associated with changing climate conditions and green trends with a goal of improving outcomes,13
while strengthening customer relationships To learn more about some of our other climaterelated products and services refer to the Products Services portion of this section,15
At Travelers we strive to lead by example and incorporate climaterelated risk control measures into our own operations To read about environmental and climaterelated risk control efforts within our operations refer to the EcoEfficient Operations section,13
For both property and casualty lines of business we consider environmental factors including weather trends and patterns alongside,13
other relevant risk variables in our underwriting evaluation process and in our underwriting strategies In addition to catastrophe modeling discussed in further detail under Catastrophe Weather Models we evaluate the findings contained in governmental reports and other external scientific studies related to climate to assess potential impacts on our underwriting and pricing decisions,13
For example we have evaluated the extent to which phases of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation the El NioSouthern Oscillation,24
the North Atlantic Oscillation and Saharan dust conditions may influence changes in basin frequency severity or US landfall risk,13
of hurricanes Our catastrophe underwriting also incorporates lessons learned from recent events including the 2017 Tubbs Fire,13
California the 2018 Camp Fire California and the 2019 Kincade Fire California as well as past events such as Hurricanes Harvey,13
and Katrina and Superstorm Sandy In addition we are studying the impacts of several more recent wildfire events in California and,13
Oregon throughout 2020 and 2021 as well as the lateseason 2021 Marshall Fire Colorado These lessons learned are reflected in our,12
y Disciplined approach to terms and conditions that are designed to make outcomes more predictable,12
y Risk Control initiatives which help us with risk mitigation selection and pricing,18
y Proprietary flood underwriting which factors in building footprints compared with segmented flood zones,5
y Proprietary wildfire underwriting which factors in terrain slope vegetation density and propensity to burn and road access,23
including proximity to fire stations as well as historical footprints,5
We are able to respond quickly to changing conditions since most of our policies renew annually This gives us the flexibility to adjust,12
our pricing underwriting strategy and related policy terms and conditions as appropriate In addition to making shortterm tactical adjustments to our underwriting strategy and product pricing based on the climaterelated risks we identify we monitor climaterelated,13
risks on a medium and longterm horizon to arrive at a holistic view of climaterelated impacts on our business further allowing us to,13
adjust and refine our strategy products and pricing,15
Our broad product diversity also mitigates our exposure to climaterelated risks We engage broadly across nine major lines of insurance,13
through our three business segmentsBusiness Insurance Bond Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance Our portfolio is balanced,3
across these lines of business and further diversified by geography and customer type and size Travelers is a leading US Commercial writer with a topfive position in five major product lines including a number one position in workers compensation and commercial multiperil1 See our Business Strategy Competitive Advantages section to learn more about our product breadth and specialization,4

Finally informed by our risk selection claim experience and risk appetite we reinsure a portion of the risks we underwrite to further,18
manage our exposure to losses and to protect our capital We cede to reinsurers a portion of these risks and pay premiums based upon the risk and exposure of the policies subject to such reinsurance For further discussion of our reinsurance program see our Annual Report on Form 10K,18
Our robust risk management practices and disciplined approach to underwriting and pricing help Travelers identify and manage both the,18
transition and the physical risks related to changing climate conditions and respond to climaterelated opportunities now and as these,13
Travelers uses various analyses and methods including proprietary and thirdparty modeling processes to make underwriting and,4
reinsurance decisions designed to manage the companys exposure to catastrophic CAT events The Enterprise Catastrophe Risk,18
Management group assesses CAT risk and manages the development of our strategic CAT efforts including the use of proprietary and,18
thirdparty models and geospatial analysis to analyze CAT events and related risks,18
This group actively monitors and evaluates changes in thirdparty models and when necessary calibrates the CAT risk model estimates,18
delivered via our proprietary modeling processes We consider historical loss experience recent events underwriting practices market,18
share analyses external scientific analysis and various other factors including nonmodeled losses to refine our proprietary view of,4
catastrophe risk Our proprietary models which are an integral part of our Enterprise Risk Management process and support our long,18
term financial strategies and objectives are updated on a regular basis as new information and techniques emerge,12

As part of an ongoing effort to enhance public awareness about the need for effective adaptation strategies to reduce losses related to natural disasters Travelers supports and participates in research advocacy and education Travelers sponsors the Insurance Institute for Business Home Safety IBHS the BuildStrong Coalition Habitat for Humanity SBP and the Wharton Risk Center to promote stronger building codes and more resilient communities and to influence industry standards and best practices We participate on the,13
board of IBHS an independent nonprofit scientific research organization supported by the insurance industry IBHS translates toptier,12
research into action to strengthen homes and businesses inform the insurance industry and increase community resiliency Over the,3
last decade IBHS has identified gaps through fullscale laboratory testing at its stateoftheart facility and has influenced changes to,2
existing building code standards and best practices to mitigate potential losses Through our research partnership with IBHS we have,12
gained a better understanding of severe wind hail and fire impacts on building engineering standards Travelers has incorporated these,5
insights into our approaches for rating and underwriting,4
We also participate on the board of the BuildStrong Coalition a group composed of national business and consumer organizations,12
companies and emergency management officials BuildStrong is dedicated to advocating for federal government legislation and,5
incentivizing state adoption and enforcement of building codes to protect property save lives and reduce loss costs,12
Following enactment of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act in 2018 the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA developed,5
a new predisaster mitigation program called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities or BRIC Through this program FEMA,3
provides federal funds to states local communities tribes and territories for mitigation activities For Fiscal Year 2021 FEMA was,10
authorized to distribute up to 1 billion in BRIC funding Long a priority for Travelers and the BuildStrong Coalition FEMA now can,12
provide states and localities with dedicated pre and postdisaster funding opportunities that will save lives and help communities reduce,10
the future costs of natural disasters by helping homeowners fortify their homes using IBHSproven technologies State and federal,5
funding for resiliency efforts is essential According to a National Institute of Building Sciences study for every 1 spent on hazard,3
mitigation the United States can save 6 in future disaster costs In these ways we are advocating for our communities which we,5
believe is good for our customers for the communities in which we live and work and for creating shareholder value over time,10

more than 2 million to pay the wages and health benefits for eligible thirdparty contract employees who provide services at Travelers,11
offices including dining and building maintenance protecting jobs that would have otherwise been lost during the economic shutdown,11

We take pride in empowering our employees to have a positive impact on their communities by serving others As community leaders,10
Travelers employees are more than strong corporate citizensthey are valuable assets to the communities in which they live and work,10
Year after year our employees efforts to give back to the communities we call home are truly remarkable We do not limit the number,10

We hear from our employees about how connecting with their communitiesby contributing their time talents and financial,10
resourcesis personally rewarding drives engagement and morale and strengthens their commitment to our companys mission,10

providing pro bono services or serving on a charitys board of directorshelps our employees develop as professionals building,12
competencies that we value in the Travelers workforce,4
While our employees had to change the way they supported their communities due to the pandemic their commitment and passion did,10
not waver In 2020 we suspended companysponsored inperson volunteer activities and instead developed a roster of virtual volunteer,10
opportunitiesa number of which were initiated by our employees In 2021 employees continued to engage virtually on an individual,11
basis and as remote teams,4

At the heart of who we are is our promise to take care of our customers In the best of times our products and services provide our,15
customers with the security to grow and thrive When disaster strikes that promise can mean helping replace a totaled vehicle or,5
helping repair a roof in time for the holidays or a special occasion In every case a Travelers policy means a trusted relationship that can,9
last years even generations and brings value to our customers our enterprise and our shareholders,3
We recognize that to deliver on our promise and to produce industryleading returns over time we need to understand our customers,3
changing needs and expectations which are increasingly shaped by their experiences both inside and outside the insurance industry,10
Meeting and exceeding those expectations require us to keep the customer at the heart of everything we do and collaborate with our,3
agent and broker partners to provide a seamless and consistent experience across all interactions and touchpoints,4
Our Head of Customer Experience a member of our Operating Committee leads our enterprisewide efforts to enhance our customer,15
experience We regularly conduct customer research to gain a realtime understanding of our customers needs We also rely on our,3
data and analytics expertise to develop intelligent models that help us predict and provide for their needs throughout the customer,3
life cycle We use these learnings to strategically invest in technologies capabilities and talent that enable us to become faster easier nimbler more digital and more personalized Through these efforts we continue to drive one of our three innovation prioritiesto provide great experiences for our customers agents and brokers,8
From a claim perspective customer experience is both a core value and a business discipline For the overwhelming majority of,15
claims we do not contract thirdparty claim adjustors and rely on our own staff in 2021 we were able to adjust virtually 100 of,12
our catastrophe claims with our own employees This structure sets us apart in the industry allowing us to process claims more,0
quickly and accurately enabling a consistently high standard of customer service Our claim handling capability is at the heart of our,4
promise to our customers and proved again in 2021 to be a significant competitive advantage that results in a better outcome for,4
our customers and a more efficient outcome for us In 2021 we were able to resolve approximately 92 of our customers property,4
claims arising out of catastrophe events within 30 days This was a particularly remarkable result when during an ongoing pandemic,13
we responded to a historically high number of catastrophe events The capacity to service virtually all of our claims with our own,5
employees also provides us with valuable insights and data which helps us continually learn from our customers and refine our,3
service processes to optimize their experience with us,1
In recent years we adjusted our claim inspection process to rely more heavily on stateoftheart digital and virtual capabilities In,12
addition to creating efficiencies for us investments in digital capabilities over the past few years have enabled us to improve the,12
customer experience in meaningful ways Our timing was good Prepandemic we anticipated a higher rate of digital adoption and,15
when the pandemic accelerated this trend we were prepared to meet the need We are now using virtual claim handling capabilities,13
on a significant majority of both auto appraisals and windhail claims all without the need for inspection by a Travelers Claim,12
professional We are also handling significantly more water claims virtually as compared with prepandemic levels In other words we,20
are delivering great experiences for our customers and a more efficient outcome for our shareholders,15
We pride ourselves on delivering for our customers but are pleased when our customer experience has been recognized by others,15

Domestic Personal Insurance Homeowners and Other2,18

Note Statistics are in part dependent on the use of estimates and are therefore subject to change,12
At Travelers we strive to exceed our customers evolving expectations and work hard to provide them with compelling experiences,15
We understand the importance of a human connection when a customer experiences a life eventsuch as buying a new home or investing in their business At the same time we understand the growing importance of technology as our customers increasingly,15
desire the ability to interact with us digitally By continually enhancing our digital and virtual capabilities we are better able to help our,1
customers protect what is important to them keep themselves and their employees safe and well and get through a covered loss Our Innovative Products Services section details the many innovative ways in which we take care of our customers every day,15
We remain committed to maintaining the human touch while delivering this exceptional digital experience Here are some of the ways,15
we work hard to do that,10
Making Sure We Have the Right,15
We aim to attract hire and develop employees with empathy integrity and professional,0
expertise Our goal is to hire and nurture people who care about the longterm success,8
of Travelers which includes caring about the wellbeing of our customers and providing,9
exceptional service to our customers and agent and broker partners,0
We are the beneficiaries of a longstanding culture anchored in trustthe trust we earn from,0
our customers in challenging times and the trust we place in each other and our agents and,0
brokers every day The importance of the Travelers Promiseour commitment to take care,2
of our customers our communities and each otheris deeply ingrained in our employees,10
and is the purpose that brings our employees to work each day with energy and enthusiasm,9
Designing exceptional experiences for customers is both an art and a science In an effort to,15
ensure that Travelers stays ahead of the competition our Customer Experience function has,4
established a humancentered design community of practice and an enterprise leadership,8
role This leader and the community provide tools best practices and standards to teams,0
across the enterprise so we can better understand the human implications in more of our,10
work Additionally we have hired experienced design professionals across our organization to,8
help create the best experiences possible across all of our service channels using an outside,15
Customer experience starts with ensuring that customers have the right product coverage,15
for their risk management needs Then in the event of a loss we have an innovative,18
workflow that gives customers the option of being better informed about coverage,18
deductibles and the claim process prior to filing an insurance claim,12
Leveraging Data and Analytics to Enhance the Customer Experience,22
We leverage our deep expertise in data and analytics to support decisionmaking and drive informed and thoughtful experience design,3
and customerfocused innovation We have more than 60 million data records related to businesses individuals and distributors,22
including virtually every business in the United States These records are curated into welldesigned proprietary data products We,22
leverage this with more than 2000 external data sets including highresolution aerial imagery covering substantially all property,1
exposures in the United States All of this data fuels our more than 1000 advanced analytical models Our models support risk selection,18
and segmentation pricing reserving claim response and more Our data and analytics advantage augmented by the latest technology,4
is significant and difficult to replicate Ultimately these capabilities lead to a better customer experience across the customer life cycle,15
at the time the customer purchases a policy during the time they remain a Travelers customer and in the event of a loss,22
Treating our customers claimants and business partners with the highest degree of integrity professionalism and empathy and paying what,0
we owe are core to our mission Thats why our Claim organization has a deliberate focus on attracting developing and retaining a high,3
performing workforce that shares our values and embraces our culture We offer our Claim professionals comprehensive training designed,8
to drive alignment with Claims values and vision and drive the ethical empathetic and effective claim handling that is critical to our success,0
Employees are regularly recognized for their ability to leave our customers feeling secure respected and cared for at every interaction,9
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics clearly establishes Travelers policy to handle claims fairly by paying what we owe and following the terms of the applicable insurance policies and all claimhandling standards contained in the applicable statutes and,0
regulations The Code specifies that Claim personnel are expected to act promptly and in good faith when handling claims These,12
principles are frequently reinforced by management at all levels within the Claim department through regular training communications,12
and claim review Claim professionals core technical training addresses coverage determination and customer communication,0
and our internal quality review of claim files includes determination of whether all coverages were correctly identified applied and,12
communicated to the customer In addition all Claim employees are required to annually certify compliance with a Claimspecific,0
compliance plan that goes above and beyond the company compliance plan to specifically address goodfaith claim handling,0
Listening to Our Customers Partners,1
At Travelers we understand the power of listening To that end we aim to provide our customers and agent and broker partners with,4
the ability to quickly and easily give us feedback on our products services and interactions Our Customer Experience teams which span,15
across all Travelers business lines regularly monitor and analyze that data to respond to customer and agent concerns while using root,22
cause analysis to improve our processes Our goals are to ensure that we understand our stakeholders from the start and that we use,12
the valuable feedback we receive to develop the products and services that our customers want and need,15
We strive to expand our ability to receive and act upon customer feedback including through the use of after call chat and,22
after transaction surveys feedback buttons or active surveys on our digital properties and deep quantitative research and indepth,12
interviews with our customers agent and broker partners and employees,8
We also utilize data from third parties such as JD Power Forrester and NICE Satmetrix along with our customer feedback to monitor,22
customers needs with the goal of providing an exceptional experience Due in part to our deep analytics from hundreds of Voice of,15
Customer Listening Programs we again improved customer satisfaction in all of our business areas this year Ultimately by listening to,3
our customers and evolving our processes and strategies to align more closely with both customer and agent and broker perspectives,3
we aim to continually improve customer experiences and loyalty,22
Here are some of the other ways we advance our goal of listening to our customers and agent and broker partners,4
y 247 Customer Advocacy Help Line With one of the most comprehensive suites of commercial and personal product offerings in the marketplace and over 30 businesses and approximately 30000 employees it could be difficult to reach the right person at the,15
right time To make it easier our Customer Advocacy team of trained specialists is available 247 to help our customers agents and,12
brokers navigate to the right person at Travelers Customers can find the Customer Advocacy telephone number and email address,22
by clicking on the Contact Us button on the homepage of Travelerscom,22
y Social Media Response Capabilities Many of todays customers prefer to interact through social media To address this trend,22
we have established a social media scanning and response capability to quickly respond to customer inquiries through social media,22
Any time a customer posts on a Travelers social media property or tags Travelers in a post on their social media property we have a,22
process to quickly review and direct that comment to the right business partner to determine if a response is needed,12
Our partnerships with our agents and brokers are a key competitive advantage for us and an important driver of our longterm success,4
We aim to be their indispensable partner together we deliver on our promise to be there for our shared customers,3
This is why we seek to enhance our digital marketing and sales tools to better support our agents and brokers and to help them identify,4
and capture new business opportunities more effectively For example we support our independent agents and brokers by providing,18
them with social media marketing and customer relationship resources These resources allow them to leverage our communication,22
platforms and our extensive product and safety content to engage with their local markets and communities,14
In 2021 Personal Insurance rolled out READY SET PIVOT Partnership for Innovation and Vision of Tomorrow a webinarbased,3
program designed to support agents in their longterm growth and evolution The program is focused on working with agents to,3
anticipate and prepare for the future of insurance,12
We also work closely with our agents when designing new products and tools for our shared customers helping to meet customers,15
where they are serve them how they want and give them what they need For example we introduced Digital Quote Proposal DQP in,6
39 states giving our agents the ability to provide customers with a dynamic interactive quote experience Building on the success of our existing auto telematics offering IntelliDrive we introduced IntelliDrivePlus in three states in 2021 At each renewal the appbased program calculates a new premium by measuring miles driven and driving behaviors such as braking acceleration speed time of day,24
and distraction We also rolled out our Digital Auto Discount in 40 states across the country providing a discount for customers who register for MyTravelers opt to go paperless for billing and policy documents and enroll in a telematics program,12
We are also extending digital capabilities in Business Insurance to benefit our agent and broker partners In November 2021 we,12
launched our external Application Programming Interface API pilot to provide our agent and broker partners with realtime access,12
to generate certificates of insurance This API enables ACORD 25 certificates of insurance to be generated in real time as proofonly,12
certificates through their proprietary broker,12
In Bond Specialty Insurance we continue to improve the agent experience by enhancing the convenience connectivity and responsiveness of our digital solutions for transactional surety We have expanded our bond processing platform Travelers Click to accommodate small commercial surety bonds up to 1 million,12
Travelers Institute educational programming also offers unique value to our network of 13500 agent and broker partners providing a distinguished thought leadership platform Over the course of more than a decade the Travelers Institute has hosted more than 600 events in collaboration with agents and brokers enhancing these relationships while providing education and risk mitigation strategies to,2

Now more than ever businesses and organizations of all sizes need to prepare with both cyber insurance and an effective cybersecurity,1
plan to manage and mitigate cyber risk Travelers understands the complexity of cyber threats and continues to proactively address,1
cyber concerns We provide policyholders with cyber protectionbefore during and after a cyber breach or incident,1
The cost of dealing with a cyber event goes beyond repairing databases strengthening security procedures or replacing lost laptops,1
Companies may face liability if their customers personally identifiable information or protected health information are compromised,22
Regulations requiring notification of affected customers also drive costs for companies that have experienced a data breach,1
compromising personal or confidential data There is also a cost involved with the efforts needed to defend the companys reputation,22
as well as with the retention of skilled computer forensics teams to determine the extent of the breach We have a number of different,1
coverages available and work with our customers and our agent and broker partners to tailor the coverages to the specific risks our,18

Travelers Promise to take care of the people we are privileged to serve,10
Our promise to help customers in the face of disasters begins well before a catastrophe hits We partner with our customers and,5
communities to help ensure they are prepared for a disaster and we employ leadingedge data and analytics capabilities to help predict,5
extreme events In the event of a catastrophe we leverage the power of our data and analytics as well as our 30000 dedicated inhouse,13
employees to provide the best possible outcomes for our affected customers,2
Travelers offers a range of resources that help our customers and the public prepare for disasters,5
y Business Continuity Planning Our network of more than 500 Risk Control consultants and our selfservice website for Business Insurance customers provide a comprehensive set of business continuity planning resources to help customers understand their unique risks We work to help businesses of all types prepare for disasters and other disruptions to their operations and supply chains,17

policymakers on the benefits of disaster preparedness and resilient communities,5
y Building Resilient Communities Through charitable partnerships Travelers and the Travelers Foundation support building strong,3
communities including through a partnership with Habitat for Humanity,10
y Wildfire Defense In 2019 we launched a Wildfire Defense Services Endorsement for California home and landlord policies with fire coverage In 2020 we extended this offering to all Small Commercial customers in California in 2021 we again expanded this,5
offeringthis time to include home landlord farm and ranch customers in Colorado This endorsement is included at no additional,24
cost to the policyholder Travelers works with Wildfire Defense Systems a private firm that specializes in wildfire mitigation which,13
uses proprietary forecasting and threat analysis to identify which Travelers customers are likely to be impacted by a wildfire For,18
atrisk properties Wildfire Defense Systems provides loss prevention services such as reducing potential fuel sources taping vents,5
y PreCatastrophe Communications The Travelers Risk Control department partners with the Personal Insurance Business,18
Insurance and Claim departments to develop and distribute catastrophe communications These alerts which are distributed,18
digitally via email and social media are designed to provide our customers with actionable prevention advice For example in 2021,22
we sent materials to our insureds in advance of five different extreme weather events to help them prepare for the event Travelers,3
also communicates with customers and agents after disasters to inform them of steps they can take to help mitigate damage file a,5
claim and begin the process of recovery,0
Leading Analytical Capabilities in Disaster Response,5
As part of our efforts to respond to our customers needs in a quick efficient and compassionate manner after a disaster or extreme,5
weather event we seek to further develop and leverage our leading analytical capabilities We have built a proprietary approach to,12
assembling data that lets us assess severe storms such as the precise size of hail forming in a storm cell to understand the footprint,13
of an event how many customers may be affected and the probable severity of the losses In addition to catastrophe CAT modeling,13
our approach uses geospatial capabilities which integrate event overlays that aggregate millions of data points from weather services,13
our weather models and ultrahighresolution aerial imagery on policy and claim locations Our sophisticated Workforce Management,13
platform leverages our geospatial insights to inform workforce deployment and Claim response decisions before during and after a,8
catastrophe event in order to engage the right catastrophe resources and technical expertise and begin deployment efforts before,5
claims are even reported All of that helps us to get the right people to the right place faster than ever before,0
We continue to innovate and enhance our analytical capabilities enabling us to fulfill our promise to take care of our customers in the,3
event of a natural disaster Our recent innovations include,5
y Using Aerial Imagery and Geospatial Technology to View Disaster Areas Through our Travelers Catastrophe Map Viewer we provide agents and brokers with searchable highresolution beforeandafter images of areas affected by disasters The Travelers,5
Catastrophe Map Viewer uses photos from aircraft equipped with marketleading aerial camera systems that are sent over certain,24
disaster areas to assess damage Images are often available within one or two days after a catastrophic event allowing our Claim,5
professionals to quickly assess damage notify customers about the condition of their property and begin the claim and recovery,9
processoften before physical access to the affected area is possible In 2021 we collected postevent imagery covering more than,24
18000 square miles in connection with 16 separate events,24
y Combining Aerial Imaging and Artificial Intelligence Learning to Detect Wildfire and Wind Losses The Travelers Wildfire Loss Detector tool helps us assess which properties are total losses after a wildfire event while the Travelers Wind Damage Detector tool,13
allows us to evaluate the severity of damage sustained in wind events Our teams leverage the machine learning capabilities built,5
into these tools to analyze thousands of images of damaged and undamaged homes immediately assessing the damage sustained,5
With these powerful tools we are able to more quickly identify customers with the most significant damage and begin the claim,5
process immediatelyeven before we have access to the areathereby allowing our customers to begin recovering and rebuilding,18
their properties sooner These capabilities also allow us to quickly identify key insights about CAT events which in turn help inform,4
our operational response and risk selection strategies going forward Our Wildfire Loss Detector tool won the 2019 Gartner Eye on,13
Innovation Award and a CIO 100 Award,15
y Using Smartphones for Quicker Safer Claim Inspections Thanks to innovative virtual inspection and measurement technology we are able to transform smartphone photos of a property into an accurate 3D model so that our Claim professionals can easily,0
inspect property damage without climbing ladders and our policyholders can provide information without having to schedule an,5
onsite inspection In other words after a disaster or another covered loss we are creating a faster and easier claim process for,5
our customers and a safer environment for our employees In 2021 we continued to accelerate the widespread use of this and,15
other virtual claim inspection tools when appropriate For example in 2021 we handled 35 more auto appraisals and 70 more,12
property water claims virtually as compared to prepandemic levels,20
Where possible we also gather data from controlled tests to improve prevention and preparation For example Travelers supports,2
the Insurance Institute for Business Home Safety IBHS which has a oneofakind controlled research facility that can generate,9
hurricaneforce winds hail and winddriven rain and embers The studies conducted in this facility allow IBHS and supporting members,13
such as Travelers to study the impacts of weather events in realworld scenarios they also allow us to analyze the results to better,13
respond to events and protect our customers and their assets For more information on IBHS and the ongoing work Travelers supports see our illustrative initiative regarding IBHS,12
Our sustained investment in innovative catastrophe response strategies sets Travelers apart from our peers We handle customer claims,5
including all catastrophe CAT claims with specially trained Travelers employees we do not generally contract CAT claims to third,0
party adjusters We employ more than 350 dedicated catastrophe response specialists across North America prepared to deploy on,5
24 hours notice Operational and logistical support specialists at the National Catastrophe Center support this CAT team which also,5
partners closely with our nearly 2000 property Claim professionals to respond to losses promptly efficiently and compassionately,12
In 2021 we continued to face unique challenges related to a high level of CAT events during the ongoing pandemic We responded to,13
71 CAT events and adjusted virtually all of the related claims with our own employees ie without the need for outside adjusters Our,12
inhouse claim capability allowed us to quickly implement procedures to handle claims virtually when possible and safely in person when,0
needed with a consistently high standard of customer service This capability is a competitive advantage that results in a better outcome,4
for our customers and a more efficient outcome for us,24
We leverage our Loss Consultation teamthe first such team in the industryin support of customers impacted by the largest,18
catastrophe events Our Loss Consultation team consists of Property and Auto coverage experts who are available seven days a week to,18
give our customers and agents the information they need to make an informed decision regarding whether to file a claim In some cases,12
they can also immediately process the claim after confirming coverage,12
Our sophisticated workforce management programs help us quickly organize triage and deploy Claim professionals with the right,8
expertise to the affected area We leverage the power of 30000 employees to support our response efforts in the event of a large catastrophe We make considerable investments in training our Claim staff and crosstrain thousands of employees to handle lower severity catastrophe claims This allows our catastrophe and claim experts to focus on highseverity claims without sacrificing quality,5
Our team follows a catastrophe playbook that includes resource deployment and communication to our customers throughout our,3
process Our Claim department regularly conducts tabletop exercises to test our readiness to respond to different disaster scenarios,5
including storms wildfires earthquakes cyber attacks and manmade events The purpose of these exercises is to evaluate and improve,13
our response to events identify any gaps in resources and implement a coordinated recovery strategy that prioritizes resources required,12
Our fleet of selfcontained Mobile Claim Offices brings immediate claim service to our customers who can stay connected using our,24
satellite technology and power their smart devices at our generatordriven charging stations Beginning in 2020 we implemented COVID19,24
safety and social distancing protocols to safely deploy our Mobile Claim Offices to support our customers following a catastrophe,9
Our National Catastrophe Center staffed by fulltime catastrophe management professionals allows us to plan and coordinate response activities in a secure environment away from the disaster areabefore during and after an event Our technical experts,5
monitor weather 247 and overlay patterns with claim trends and our customers locations This approach enables us to identify,13
potential events early and to transform information quickly into action Additionally our command center is equipped with state,5
oftheart data management visualization and teleconferencing tools and is linked to hundreds of data sources including the Global,22
Forecast System the National Weather Service Doppler radar network Travelers Customer Service Centers and our internal systems,3
that track claim metrics and staff resource availability These capabilities provide us with the ability to deploy resources effectively and,17
on a timely basis which in turn allows us to better assist our customers and to respond to and resolve claims more quickly,12
For more information about how we help our customers and agents manage catastrophic weather events see our Travelers Emergency Response video,5
Overall our catastrophe CAT response approach enables Travelers to respond quickly effectively and compassionatelyand,5
with integritywhen our customers need us most Despite the added logistical difficulties inherent in CAT response our CAT claim,4
performance consistently meets or exceeds our internal benchmarks for claim handling In 2021 approximately,0
y 92 of property claims arising out of CAT events were resolved within 30 days of receipt of the claim notice,12
y 83 of CAT claims were paid within a week of inspection,0
y 54 of CAT claims were paid the same day as inspection1,12
These results were particularly remarkable given that we responded to 71 catastrophe events and over 100000 catastrophe notices of loss in 2021 In addition to being good for our customers our ability to quickly adjust claims plays an important role in helping our communities in their recovery efforts This short documentary demonstrates the impact our CAT response can have on customers agents and brokers and communities,5

Most of our greenhouse gas GHG emissions are from office activity mobile combustion eg claim vehicles commuting and business,25
travel While we strive to reduce our emissions our primary climaterelated risks and opportunities relate to our property insurance business and claim service which we cover in the Climate Strategy Disaster Preparedness Response and Public Policy sections of this site,13

our energy consumption and waste not only to reduce our environmental impact but they also to lower our operating expenses Our GHG Inventory Goals page summarizes our progress to reduce direct and indirect GHG emissions and references our new goal of becoming carbon neutral across our owned operations by 2030,25
While the pandemic has resulted in decreased inoffice activity mobile combustion and business travel we continue to work actively on reducing our environmental impact Our new open workspace environment reduces our footprint and incorporates enhanced technology including remote collaboration tools and videoenabled conference rooms to reduce nonessential business travel In addition we provide incentives to our employees to use mass transit alternatives and offer parking incentives for carpoolers,9
In 2019 we also began to reduce our environmental impact by encouraging our personal insurance customers to convert to paperless,24
billing We committed to fund the planting of a tree for every paperless billing conversion in Personal Insurance As of Earth Day 2022 we have funded the planting or conservation of over 3 million trees through our partnership with American Forests As a result we are now planting or conserving more trees than we are consuming This initiative is just one example of our commitment to aggressively,23
seek ways to create shared valuein other words ways to simultaneously protect our environment create a streamlined experience for,10

In addition all Travelersowned campuses are ENERGY STAR certified which means that we are in the top quartile in terms of energy performance standards and undergo an annual recertification process,24
Travelers continues to analyze the companys operational impacts on the environment and works to minimize negative impacts We,23
utilize an environmental management system that regularly reviews our operations to measure our impacts and to identify opportunities,17

into account when developing our capital expenditure plan For example we are upgrading all lighting in our Travelersowned Hartford,12
campus to LED fixtures to reduce our utility consumption extend the asset life of our lights and provide an enhanced environment for,24
Travelers employees We expect this effort to be completed by yearend 2022,12

y Extend our advantage in risk expertise Understanding risk and the products and services our customers need to manage risk has been foundational to our success for decades Core to that is our ability to balance the science and art of riskbased decision,18
making based on data and analytics That skill set requires a combination of deep expertise and a special culture that values,8
collaboration and longterm success It is an important competitive advantage developed over a long period of time and one we,4
believe is very difficult to replicate We seek to extend our advantage by investing in areas such as predictive modeling advanced,4
analytics robotic process automation machine learning artificial intelligence and new products,4
y Provide great experiences for our customers agents and brokers Across all of our businesses we are focused on becoming faster easier nimbler more digital more mobile and more personalized When we think there is a proprietary advantage we,4
invest in building these capabilities ourselves In other cases we partner with invest in or acquire organizationsboth established,12

to artificial intelligence AI we systematically assess new technologies plan for their potential impact and identify the business,1
opportunities that may arise as a result This brief video describes our approach and identifies the trends we are watching,18
Building Perspectives of the Future at Travelers,3
In addition to watching industry trends we continually evaluate evolving risks to our customers and help them with mitigation opportunities We can test reallife scenarios at our research and training facilitiesClaim University the National Catastrophe Center and the Risk Control Forensics Laboratory Sharing what we learn with our underwriters helps them better select and price risks and develop products and services that address emerging risks to meet customer needs These insights also give our Risk Control,18

and manage exposures to loss In addition our learnings allow our customers to help improve their employees safety and wellness,9
as well as their own business results Finally these insights enable our Claim professionals to help our customers recover from losses,18

outside of Travelers to broaden our perspective gain early access to new ideas and develop solutions to some of the most compelling,3
challenges impacting the industry We position ourselves in the flow of innovation around the globe by collaborating with incubators,3
startups venture capital and private equity firms and others that are developing exciting new technologies and capabilities We partner,4
with incubators like Plug and Play and FinTech Innovation Lab New York both innovation programs that bring together startups and,18
some of the worlds largest corporations Through these partnerships we participate in initiatives such as the Hartford InsurTech,12
Hub a collaboration of insurance carriers representatives of the city of Hartford and community stakeholders all focused on industry,12
evolution through collaboration and innovation The goal of this group is to develop a local innovation ecosystem supported by local,4
resources capabilities and talent in which insurance technology startups can grow and flourish We view our involvement in this,8
Hartfordbased initiative as an investment in both our communities and our business,10
Our external partnerships also help us drive coinnovation on data and AI capabilities We continue to assemble new thirdparty datasets,1
while refining our existing data to unlock new sources of insights and drive automation and productivity For example we set out to,18
find new ways to expedite the process used to detect total losses from wildfires specifically in the most prevalent fire loss areas of the,5
western United States Using thirdparty imagery collected from previous California wildfires we tapped into our property boundary,13
data to isolate home locations in the pictures We then crowdsourced the tagging of 40000 images enabling a deep learning model to,4
analyze the data and immediately assess which properties were total losses The identification of total losses from imagery enables us,18
to initiate the claim process faster which in turn allows our customers to begin recovering and rebuilding their properties more quickly,18
Driving an Innovation Mindset Velocity,3
We built our internal innovation ecosystem to develop the key capabilities needed for the future by leveraging the best talent and ideas,8

management focus to product teams These small teams made up of individuals from a mix of disciplines and functions are responsible,8
for specific products and empowered to make decisions that help drive business outcomes and speed to market,15
Weve also shifted to an engineering mindset throughout the Technology Operations teams such that instead of simply translating,3
business requirements into code our engineers are more directly integrated into the business and are thus better able to understand,12
and appreciate the digital business drivers in todays market These mindset shifts help inform how we interact with our customers,3
agents brokers and employees to create frictionless digital experiences,4

ecosystem and datacentric culture to provide new products and services to the insurance market Here are some examples of those,15
innovative products and services and how we are using technology to deliver them,15
y Insurance quote requests often require significant manual effort to extract information from,12
submitted documents before an underwriter can fully evaluate and price the risk By organizing,18
valuable unstructured data from submission documents artificial intelligence AI augments our,1
underwriting capabilities enhancing risk selection and increasing efficiency while also enabling,18
agents and brokers to write more business more quickly,4

appropriate update our political activity policy,12
Highlights of our current policies and practices with regard to political campaign contributions and expenditures and lobbying activity,12
Board Oversight and Governance around Political Activities,12
Travelers conducts its political activities including lobbying under the oversight of the Nominating and Governance Committee of the,12
Board which is composed solely of independent directors Our Head of Government Relations and General Counsel review all corporate,7
political campaign contributions and expenditures as well as all dues and other payments made to relevant trade associations and other,12
organizations Lobbying activities on behalf of Travelers require prior approval of the companys Government Relations professionals,12
Further the Head of Government Relations reports semiannually to the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board regarding,12
political contributions and expenditures made by Travelers including dues and other payments made to relevant trade associations and,12
other organizations lobbying activities and public policy issues of priority to Travelers In addition the Nominating and Governance,12
Committee oversees our policy regarding political activities and any changes to that policy The Nominating and Governance Committee,12
provides the full Board with a report on the companys political activities at least twice per year,7
As noted above the Nominating and Governance Committees oversight of political activities includes the companys membership in,12
and other support of trade associations and other organizations Our Government Relations staff and trade association colleagues,12
promote and advance our position on issues having a direct or indirect impact on our business Our membership in a particular trade,12
association does not suggest that we agree with such associations position on every issue nor does it suggest that Travelers joined such,12
association primarily due to its lobbying activities,12
No Corporate Contributions to Federal Candidates or Political Party Committees,12
In accordance with current applicable law political contributions to federal candidates and federal political party committees may not,12
be and are not made by Travelers Such contributions may be made by our political action committee The Travelers Companies Inc,12
Political Action Committee TPAC which is not funded by corporate funds but rather by the personal funds given voluntarily by our,12
employees TPACs Contributions Committee whose objective is to advance the best interests of Travelers and its shareholders makes,12
decisions concerning the use of those funds TPAC reports this spending in filings with the Federal Election Commission which are,12
Our participation in the political process is governed by law in addition to internal policy Travelers complies with all applicable laws and,12

Commission website containing reports filed on behalf of TPAC,12

issues and government entities lobbied,12
Travelers has not made any direct independent expenditures at either the federal or state level and does not have any plans to do,12
so during the current election cycle Direct independent expenditures if any would consist of funds spent by Travelers itself on,12
communications in support of or in opposition to a candidates campaign without coordination with the candidate Our political,12
activity policy provides that Travelers may not make direct independent expenditures in a candidate campaign unless and only,12
if it believes that an exception to that policy is justified by business need and it obtains the prior approval of the Nominating and,12
Governance Committee or its Chair If any such direct independent expenditures are made Travelers would disclose them on its,12
website in the same manner and at the same time as it discloses campaign contributions,12

on businesses and the US economy It is estimated that between 2015 and 2018 the total economic burden of the opioid crisis in the,18
United States was at least 631 billion of that amount nearly onethirdor 205 billionis said to be attributable to increased health care spending and an estimated 15or 96 billionis related to lost productivity costs1,2
Using Our Data and Analytics to Help Reduce Addiction,2
By analyzing workers compensation claim data Travelers created the Early Severity Predictor model which can help identify an injured employees likelihood of experiencing chronic pain using weighted predictors at key points during the life of a claim By adjusting medical care and resources the Early Severity Predictor model can help address potential drivers of chronic paina condition that is largely treated with opioids or other painkillersand reduce the risk of opioid addiction,9
This program has benefited more than 90000 injured employees since its inception in 2015 In addition to improving the recovery,9
experience for tens of thousands of injured employees the program has resulted in losscost savings of more than 150 million by helping reduce surgeries performed and opioids prescribed We apply this model to all of the losttime workers compensation claims we receive,11

Opioid Addiction and the Construction Industry,2
Construction sites present health and safety risks that can lead to worker injuries such as strains sprains broken bones and head,9
traumas which can result in chronic pain and therefore opioid treatment Many workers compensation claims submitted to Travelers from the construction industry involve opioid prescriptions To help curb prescription opioid abuse we use our Early Severity Predictor alongside our comprehensive pharmacy management program which monitors drug interactions excessive dosing and abuse patterns,9
to reduce the risk of opioid dependency With these two efforts combined we have seen a nearly 50 reduction in the use of opioids,2
among the injured construction workers we have helped since 2015,9
Furthermore our nurses and Claim professionals review claims and create specific action plans for injuries that often include physical,9
therapy and other interventions to prevent acute pain from becoming chronic This approach is particularly significant for the,9
construction industry where Travelers claim data show that injured workers who suffer from chronic pain can be out of work for,9
significantly longer periods of time than those in other industries,24
Engaging Injured Employees in Recovery,9
Employers can also help injured employees avoid opioid dependency and other barriers to a successful return to work by implementing a postinjury management strategy This is a key part of the Travelers Corridor of Care process which takes a systematic and positive approach to handling employee injuries Responding promptly to injuries and providing attentive medical case management can help,9
prevent an injured employee from developing chronic pain for which opioids may be prescribed This type of active management can,9
help an injured employee return to work as soon as medically appropriate Helping employees recover from their injuries can also have,9
a positive ripple effect within an organization helping to prevent disruptions in production quality and morale In addition Travelers continues to support research initiatives and make investments in new solutions to help injured employees through the claim process and enhance engagement through CustomCareSM,9

TRAVELERS INSTITUTE Distracted Driving Every Second Matters,9
At Travelers our simple and unwavering mission for creating shareholder value is to deliver superior returns on equity by leveraging our competitive advantages generate earnings and capital substantially in excess of our growth needs and thoughtfully rightsize capital and grow book value per share over time Executing this financial strategy has produced industryleading returns over time and 2021 was no exception,4
Travelers generated very strong core income of 35 billion and 1394 of core income per diluted share up 33 compared to the,12
prior year Core return on equity increased by more than 200 basis points to an excellent 137 a meaningful spread above both the 10,18
year Treasury and our cost of equity,12
We delivered record underlying underwriting income for the year of 23 billion aftertax and a very strong underlying combined ratio,18
of 903 Our average underlying underwriting income for the past five years was 34 greater than the average underlying underwriting,18
income for the five years prior to that Significantly underlying underwriting income as a percentage of core income in 2021 remained,12
at a historically high level an indication of the high quality of our earnings In other words when you adjust for the things over which,18
we have less control such as catastrophes prior year reserve development and the interest rate environment we delivered operating,12
performance that was very strong compared to our historical average Our 2021 results demonstrate that our strategy of innovating to,3
grow the top line at attractive returns and improving productivity and efficiency continues to pay off,4
During the year we improved our expense ratio to a historically low 294 a 50basispoint improvement over the prior year and a 7,12
improvement over the past five years We achieved this by leveraging cuttingedge technology and workflow enhancements and not by,15
depriving our business of important investments Improving operating leverage continues to be a strategic priority for us It gives us the,18
flexibility to invest the gains in our strategic priorities or let the benefit fall to the bottom line,3
Our cash flow from operations reached an alltime record of 73 billion in 2021 This reflects the benefit of continued increases in,18
premium volume strong profitability and lowerthannormal overall claim payouts as courtroom and other settlement activity remained,4
below historic levels throughout the year We assume that the lowerthannormal payout pattern is ultimately a timing issue and as,11
a result when establishing our reserves and pricing our products we are continuing to assume that elevated severity related to social,15
Our cash flow from operations has increased significantly over the last five years with the average annual cash flow from operations,18
for that period nearly 50 higher than the average for the five years prior to that Strong cash flow enables us to make significant,18
investments in our business return excess capital to shareholders and grow our investment portfolio Over the past five years our,3
investment portfolio grew an impressive 169 billion or 24 to 874 billion at yearend,18
Turning to the top line todays production generates tomorrows earned premiums In 2021 we delivered record net written premiums,4
of 32 billion for the year up 7 compared to the prior year This represents the 12th consecutive year of net written premium growth,18
All three of our business segments contributed to the strong topline performance with Business Insurance up 4 Bond Specialty,3
Insurance up 14 and Personal Insurance up 10 This premium growth has been driven by high levels of retention higher pricing and,12
the addition of highquality new business Significantly we have strong confidence in the profitability of the business that we are putting,0
on the books as it comes from products geographies classes of business and distribution partners that we know well,15
We believe that return on equity is the right way to measure our success and that any commitment to deliver an industryleading return,18
on equity over time requires a strategy to grow over time Across all our businesses our strategic focus continues to include creating,3
opportunities to write more business through retaining and growing our relationships with our highquality inforce accounts and,0
bringing our franchise value to new customers To that end several years ago we laid out a plan to achieve profitable growth in the,3
context of the forces of change that we had previously identified as impacting the industrynamely changing consumer expectations,3
emerging technology trends more sophisticated data and analytics and evolving distribution models,1
In light of these trends we have established key innovation priorities and are investing in capabilities consistent with those priorities,3
Notwithstanding a challenging environment for the industry including the second year of a global pandemic we have faithfully and,13
consistently executed on this strategy This relentless execution has paid off Since 2016 we have grown net written premiums at a,4
compound annual growth rate of 51 substantially outpacing both the growth in gross domestic product over the same period and,24
our compound annual growth rate of 27 for the prior years in the decade,18
At the same time as we have grown net written premiums we have also improved our underlying marginsour underlying combined,4
ratio over the last two years has been meaningfully below the 10year average That tells us that we have not grown by either,18
underpricing the product or taking on too much risk,0
The performance of our investment portfolioa key source of stability and strength for Travelerscontinues to be exceptional Our,18
investment portfolio is managed first and foremost to support our insurance operations and accordingly is positioned to meet our,3
obligations to policyholders under almost every foreseeable circumstanceanything from a global pandemic to a significant natural,12
disaster to a financial crisis With this in mind we are focused on riskadjusted returns and credit quality rather than reaching for yield,18
that is not commensurate with the underlying risk,18
Our asset allocation is designed so that the predictable stream of investment income from our fixed income portfolio will provide a firm,12
and reliable foundation for our business In addition the allocation between fixed income and alternative investments is designed such,12
that when the market is challenging for our alternative investment portfolio we still have a shot at reaching our target returns and when,4
the alternative portfolio has a strong year we will benefit from the upside,18
Our performance over the past two years is a perfect illustration of how effective this disciplined investment strategy is in managing,3
through very different and volatile market conditions In 2020 we saw record low interest rates the 10year Treasury hit a stunning,18
low of 0318 and we experienced significant volatility in the equity markets that negatively impacted the returns from our alternative,18
investment portfolio Nonetheless we delivered strong 2020 net investment income of 19 billion aftertax contributing to a strong,18
core return on equity of 113 In 2021 the alternative investment portfolio benefited from the recovery in the equity markets and the,18
same disciplined strategy and wellconstructed portfolio delivered net investment income of 25 billion aftertax contributing to an,18
industryleading core return on equity of 137,4
Strategy not serendipity drove these strong results throughout two very different economic and market environmentsthat is the,4
value of our thoughtful and disciplined approach,10
Underwriting excellence is of course key to our success and there is nothing more critical to underwriting excellence than a culture,0
that values strong performance over time and understands how to balance the art and science of decision making based on data and,4
analytics This culture alone is a significant competitive advantage and one that we believe is very hard to replicate,4
A critical component of our culture is our granular approach to underwriting In our commercial businesses that means execution on,3
an accountbyaccount or classbyclass basis In personal lines it means a very high degree of segmentation by account product and,15
geography With that and our advanced data and analytics we thoughtfully select the risks we write and price our products deliberately,15
with our target return in mind,18
Given the elevated frequency and severity of catastrophes in recent years including once again in 2021 we will take a moment to,13
highlight the work we have done over the last several years in terms of the strategic management of our catastrophe exposure,18
Underwriting excellence is of course key to our success and theres nothing more critical to underwriting excellence than a culture that,0
values strong performance over time and understands how to balance the art and science of decision making based on data and analytics,4
Consistent with our general approach of recognizing assessing and addressing trends rapidly we have taken decisive action in anticipation,18
of continued elevated weather frequency and severity Our efforts started with talent We have added experts in data science meteorology,13
geophysics and environmental engineering among others to our catastrophe management organization We have also established,13
dedicated teams for each catastrophe peril with the goal of developing industryleading scientific and underwriting expertise,18
We have incorporated the learnings into our product development risk selection pricing capital allocation and claim response The,4
insights we have developed have enabled us to supplement standard vendor catastrophe models with our own sophisticated peril,4
byperil view This gives us a refined granular view of catastrophe risk incorporating proprietary variables such as complex roof,18
characteristics tree and brush density and location intelligence down to the parcel level These variables are incorporated into our,23
product development enhancing our segmentation They are also integrated into proprietary algorithms that we use at the point of sale,15
to inform risk selection and decisions about terms and conditions,4
Taken together these efforts have enabled us to manage our exposure to catastrophes more effectively and while there is always the,13
potential for us to have outsized exposure to an event the positive impact on our results this year and in recent years is evident In 2021,18
our share of both wildfire and hurricane peril losses was several percentage points lower than our market share in the affected areas,13
Over the past five years our share of property casualty losses relative to total domestic PC industry losses has declined significantly,18
compared to the five years prior to that and has been meaningfully lower than our corresponding market share,4

Consistent and Successful LongTerm Financial Strategy Delivers Shareholder Value,3
It is important to consider our financial results and our strategic initiatives in the context of what we are ultimately trying to achieve At,3
Travelers our simple and unwavering mission for creating shareholder value is to,3
y Deliver superior returns on equity by leveraging our competitive advantages,4
y Generate earnings and capital substantially in excess of our growth needs,3
y Thoughtfully rightsize capital and grow book value per share over time,4
The results we deliver are due to our deliberate and consistent approach to creating shareholder value We have been clear for many,3
years that one of our crucial responsibilities is to produce an appropriate return on equity for our shareholders This has meant,4
developing and executing financial and operational plans consistent with our goal of achieving superior returns which we defined many,3
years ago as a midteens core return on equity over time We emphasize that the objective is measured over time because we recognize that the macroeconomic environment loss cost trends weather and geopolitical and other factors impact our results from year to,18
year and that there are yearsor longer periodsand environments in which a midteens return is not attainable In that regard we,12
established the midteens goal at a time when the 10year Treasury was yielding around 5 and midteens was simply the quantification,4
of what qualified as an industryleading return in that environment As we have said before our ability to achieve a midteens return over,4
time going forward will depend on interest rates returning to more normal levels by historical standards In any event we always seek to,12
deliver industryleading returns over time,18

into account our industryleading low volatility The level and consistency of our return on equity over time reflect the value of our,4
competitive advantages and the discipline with which we run our business,4
A Balanced Approach to Rightsizing Capital,4

During this period we have also returned a significant amount of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends and share,4
repurchases Over the last decade we increased our dividend each year and grew dividends per share at an average annual rate of,18
Bar chart displaying Dividends Per Share steadily increasing each year from 2012 to 2021,18
In 2021 they were 349 compared to 337 in 2020,12
Notably since we began our share repurchase program in 2006 we have returned nearly 50 billion of excess capital to our,4
shareholders including through nearly 38 billion of share repurchases which is well in excess of the market capitalization of the,4
company at that time Just by virtue of our share repurchase program your percentage ownership of Travelers increased 5 during,4
2021 alone If you owned Travelers stock when we began our share repurchase program in 2006 your percentage ownership has,4
increased by nearly 300 These percentage increases were even higher if you participated in our dividend reinvestment program,18
Our capital management strategy has been an important driver of shareholder value creation over time Our first objective for the,3
capital we generate is to reinvest it in our businessorganically and inorganicallyto create shareholder value For example as we,3
continue to grow our top line as we have for the past few years we will retain more capital to support that growth Also we continue to,3
invest in everything from talent to technology to further our ambitious innovation agenda and advance our strategic objectives,8
Having said that we are disciplined stewards of our shareholders capital To the extent that we generate capital that we cannot reinvest,3
consistent with our objective of generating industryleading returns over time we will manage it the same way we have for more than,18
a decadeby returning it to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases By returning excess capital to our investors,4
we give them the ability to allocate their investment dollars as they see fit including by investing in companies with different growth,4
profiles or capital needs thereby efficiently allocating capital across the economy Over time that efficient allocation of capital in the,12
marketplace contributes to a stronger economy,4

Ultimately it is the success of our strategywith all its component partsthat drives our total return to shareholders over time These,3
unprecedented times are an important reminder that we have a wellestablished track record of managing the company to create value,3
over the long term through periods of weather volatility through anticipated and unanticipated developments impacting loss trends,18
