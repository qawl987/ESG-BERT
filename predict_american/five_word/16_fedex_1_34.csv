70 solutions to increase mobility options for,24
deliveries in urban centers including electric,24
vehicles and cargo bicycles In China FedEx,19
Express is working with Neolix to evaluate the,2
implementation of an autonomous electric,24
delivery vehicle Additionally our growing,15
fleet of electric bikes reduces noise levels,21
and combustion engine exhaust compared,21
to traditional lastmile vehicles In some,6
international cities such as London and Toronto,12
electric bikes are directly replacing our vans,24
In addition we continue to electrify forklifts,24
airport ground service equipment and other,5
nonroad vehicles across our operating,24
companies Through our phased approach we,12
are reducing fuel and maintenance costs and,24
anticipate improving our efficiency even further,24
Before our purchased electric vehicles are,24
deployed we must ensure the necessary vehicle,5
charging infrastructure and technology is in place,24
at our facilities Building this infrastructure,2
requires significant time and capital but the,18
commitment of our team members to our,10
collaboration with power utilities state and local,12
strategic approaches to overcome this challenge,3

Our vehicle electrification strategy builds upon,24
from a 2005 baseline and has a goal to achieve a,12
us stay on track to deliver on our broader low,3
FedEx Express fuel efficiency improvements,24
carbon infrastructure solutions While our,1
achieved by optimizing driving routes and,24
electricity usage will significantly increase due to,24
replacing vehicles within our fleet with more,24
50 improvement by 2025 Looking forward,12
we are focusing on enhancing our fleet fuel,24
efficiency and avoiding fuel use through the,24
electric vehicle charging we are developing,24
efficient models We are using other approaches,4
We continue to invest in and seek the,12
development of viable costeffective alternative,17
fuels to reduce aircraft and vehicle emissions We,24
collaborate with industries government agencies,12
academic institutions and alternative fuel,12
suppliers to advance production and encourage,17
the adoption of alternative fuels to help,24
revolutionize the logistics and aviation industries,15
Our global fleet includes more than 4100,15
alternative fuel vehicles including hybrid electric,24
liquefied or compressed natural gas liquefied,25
petroleum gas and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles,25
and we will continue to grow our alternative fuel,24
fleet in the coming years subject to availability,24
FedEx jet fuel use accounts for around 61 of,24
our reported emission footprint and we have an,21
established goal to obtain 30 of our jet fuel from,24
alternative fuels by 2030 To help achieve this,24
goal we support responsible policies to advance,12
alternative fuel technologies for the commercial,24
transportation sector This advocacy work is,12
focused on supporting incentives that accelerate,12
sustainable aviation fuel production and making,24
lowcarbon fuel more available and affordable for,24
airlines general and business aviation and other,21
users Enhanced sustainable aviation fuel,24
production and deployment would enable the,15
aviation industry to continue its progress in,12
improving efficiency reducing its emissions and,24
supporting job growth and energy security,3
We support alternative fuel options and in FY21,24
50 of the diesel FedEx Ground sold to service,12
providers was comprised of various biodiesel,24
blends resulting in almost 16000 metric tons of CO2e avoided We are also actively exploring alternative fuels for certain categories of vehicles,24
that are currently not easily electrifiable such as,4
longhaul Class 8 trucks We are collaborating,24
with manufacturers to test and pilot projects,15
invest in research and development and build,2
test sites to rapidly evaluate various technologies,4
Aircraft fuel conservation and fleet modernization,24
In 2008 we set an aggressive goal to reduce,12
our aircraft emissions intensity 20 by 2020,21
compared to a 2005 baseline In 2011 we,12
stretched our 2020 target to an even more,12
ambitious 30 reduction from our 2005 baseline,12
A global increase in shipping volume,15
exacerbated by the COVID19 pandemic,13
delayed the retirement of certain older aircraft,24
and led us to fall short of our goal In 2021,12
we continued to experience unprecedented,24
demand for our express delivery services,24
due to the ongoing pandemic and increase in,13
ecommerce volumes rivaling our peak holiday,4
season traffic Our dedication to the global community never wavered and we continued,10
to provide essential transportation of critical,5
protective equipment PPE and COVID19,5
vaccines across the world Due to the increased,2
demand for essential deliveries ecommerce,24
and other global shipments in 2021 our aircraft,15
emissions increased 12 compared to our 2020,21
performance However we have reduced our,18
overall aircraft emissions intensity by 27 since,21
2005 primarily because of our ongoing FedEx,18
Fuel Sense and aircraft modernization initiatives,24
As we continue dealing with the ongoing,5
challenges posed by the pandemic we will,13
remain agile and flex our networks to align,3
with shipping volumes and other customer,15
needs without losing sight of our longterm,3
To help reach our goal of carbon neutral,24
operations by 2040 we are building on the,3
success of FedEx Fuel Sense Despite the,18
significant increase in shipping volume and flight,15
activity due to the COVID19 pandemic our team,13
members remained committed to improving our,10
fuel efficiency and reducing our environmental,24
impact which led to 65 million gallons of jet fuel,24
savings from our FedEx Fuel Sense program in,24
FY21 Since the programs founding in 2006 we,12
have implemented 70 fuelsaving initiatives,12
saving 948 million gallons of jet fuel and avoiding 93 million metric tons of CO2e,24
We maintain one of the largest fastest and,4
most innovative cargo aircraft fleets in the world,24
at the end of FY21 and our MD1030 fleet is expected to retire by the end of December,3
