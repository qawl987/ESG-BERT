Googles 2022 Environmental Report features data performance highlights,3
and progress against our targets from our 2021 fiscal year January 1 to,12
December 31 2021 It also mentions notable targets set in 2022,12
This report outlines how were driving positive environmental impact,10
throughout our business in five key ways designing efficient data centers,24
advancing carbonfree energy creating sustainable workplaces building,15
better devices and services and empowering users with technology,2
For more information about our sustainability strategy see Googles,3
Sustainability website and sustainability reports page For more information,15
about our overall corporate responsibility initiatives see Googles,10
commitments as well as sustainability and related information For more,12
information about our business see the About Google and Alphabet Investor,3
We believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect,12
our planet Sustainability is one of our core values at Google and we strive,15
to build sustainability into everything we do,15
Weve been a leader on sustainability and climate change since Googles,13
founding over 20 years ago These are some of our key achievements over,3
2007 We became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations,24
2017 We became the first major company to match 100 of our annual electricity,24
use with renewable energy which weve achieved for five consecutive years,24
2020 We issued 575 billion in sustainability bondsthe largest sustainability,3
or green bond issuance by any company in history at the time,12
2021 We matched 66 of our data center electricity use with regional,24
carbonfree sources on an hourly basis,24
Our sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars accelerating,3
the transition to carbonfree energy and a circular economy empowering,12
everyone with technology and benefiting the people and places where we,15
We strive to build sustainability into everything we do,15
from the growth of carbon,25
and drive netpositive impact using,3
To accelerate the transition to a carbonfree and circular economy in 2020,3
we launched our third decade of climate action and were now working,13
toward a new set of ambitious goals By 2030 we aim to,12
Achieve netzero emissions across all of our operations and value chain,24
including our consumer hardware products,15
Become the first major company to run on carbonfree energy 24 hours a day,24
seven days a week 365 days a year,12
Enable 5 gigawatts of new carbonfree energy through investments in our key,24
Help more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of,10
1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually,25
We also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations,17
products and supply chains and to enable others to do the same,17
As part of our goal to achieve netzero emissions across all of our operations,25
and value chain by 2030 we aim to reduce the majority of our emissions,25
versus our 2019 baseline before 2030 and plan to invest in naturebased,12
and technologybased carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining,24
emissions We know this will be a challenging journey and we expect our,25
progress toward this goal to be nonlinear While our total GHG emissions,25
increased from 2020 to 2021 were committed to achieving GHG reductions,25
throughout our operations and value chain,3
To empower everyone with technology weve committed to help 1 billion,24
people make more sustainable choices by the end of 2022 through our core,15
products We introduced ecofriendly routing in Google Maps new features,15
to book flights or purchase appliances that have lower carbon footprints,24
and Nest Renew a program to support clean energy from home And when,24
people come to Google Search with questions about climate change we,13
show information from authoritative sources like the United Nations,12
To benefit the people and places where we operate weve set goals to,10
replenish more water than we consume by 2030 and to support water security,20
in communities where we operate Were focused on three areas enhancing,10
our stewardship of water resources across Google offices and data centers,20
replenishing our water use and improving watershed health and ecosystems,23
in waterstressed communities and sharing technology and tools that help,10
everyone predict prevent and recover from water stress,20
At Google we remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability and well,3
continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our,9
planet Were proud of what weve achieved so far and were energized to help,10
move the world closer to a more sustainable and carbonfree future for all,10
The following section provides a snapshot of our performance as of the end,18
of 2021demonstrating how were strengthening our business by reducing,3
the environmental impact of our operations and working to empower people,10
everywhere to live more sustainably,24
For a more complete overview of our performance over time see the,18
On average a Google data center is twice as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center1,24
Compared with five years ago we now deliver around five times as much computing power with the same amount of electrical power,24
In 2021 the average annual PUE2 for our global fleet of data centers was 110 compared with the industry average of 1573meaning that Google data centers use about six times less overhead energy,24
operational GHG emissions after compensations,25
Whether someone is using Google at home or as part of an organization running Google Cloud or Google Workspace all products in our Cloud are carbon neutralmeaning that the operational GHG emissions associated with running workloads on our infrastructure have been reduced through procurement of renewable energy and any residual emissions have been compensated for with highquality carbon credits4,25
In 2021 we diverted 78 of waste from our global data center operations away from landfills,19
In 2021 27 of components used for server upgrades were refurbished inventory,15
In 2021 we resold more than 49 million components into the secondary market for reuse by other organizations,15

Over the past decade Google purchased more renewable energy than any other company6 From 2010 to 2021 we purchased a total of more than 73 million MWh of renewable energy through PPAs via onsite generation and from the electric grids where our facilities are located7,24
From 2010 to 2021 we made commitments to invest nearly 33 billion in renewable energy projects with an expected combined capacity of approximately 87 GW These targeted investments go beyond our purchases of renewable energy for our own operational footprint,24
From 2010 to 2021 we signed more than 60 agreements totaling more than 7 GW of renewable energy Over that period weve committed approximately 6 billion to purchase clean energy from wind and solar projects globally through 20405,24
From 2011 to 2021 our renewable energy purchasing resulted in a cumulative 65 reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions as compared with a businessasusual scenario in which we didnt procure renewable energy via PPAs,24
From 2011 to 2021 our carbon intensity per unit of revenue decreased by 81,12
