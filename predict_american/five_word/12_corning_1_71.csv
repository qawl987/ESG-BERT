effectively to serve our stakeholders during a pandemic has required that we embrace creative new ways of doing business Were living through the kind of moment that tends to bring true character to light At Corning our Values are evident in our actions In the face of multiple challenges weve prioritized protecting our people and delivering for customers Were collaboratively problem solving in the public and private sectors to achieve purposedriven outcomes And weve accelerated with even greater urgency the integration of social and environmental considerations sustainable practices and good governance into our business,10
We also recognize that we have the opportunity to share resources and leadership on a range of important issues Society shares a set of significant problems many of which are systemic and longstanding such as climate change and inequality Our company embraces the increased demands and expectations put on organizations seeking to drive continued success,13
Weve always operated under the conviction that financial performance is not sufficient we must strive to be a catalyst for positive change and help make the world just a little bit better This is a fundamental aspiration for a company paving the way for its next 170 years of success,3
At Corning we know glass Time and again weve proven the potential and versatility of this incredible material employing its remarkable set of technical attributes to forge a path forward when the world needs impactful change,15
Our deep understanding and expertise in the fields of glass science and engineering stretch back nearly two centuries And every day we continue to create and characterize new glasses from the nearly infinite range of potential compositions Clearly were working with a powerful problem solver Thats why we dedicate a significant portion of revenue to research development and engineering It is central to our purpose we seek to lead in capabilities that are vital to progress And our track record shows the benefits our investments deliver for all stakeholders,3
For 170 years weve provided ongoing value to society with lifechanging and lifesaving innovations Today were positioned at the center of major industry transformations touching many facets of daily life Were helping our customers move toward a world with nearly infinite and ubiquitous bandwidth a world where you can do more right from your mobile device protected by cover materials that can withstand even greater abuse a world with large lifelike displays one where cars are cleaner autonomous and connected and a world in which medicines are individualized effective and safe,15
Looking forward I believe that Cornings model for ongoing value creation and the way it defines our relationship with all stakeholders is more relevant than ever As we detail in this report the confluence of consequential events over the last year and the need to operate,3
For 170 years weve provided ongoing value to society with lifechanging and lifesaving innovations,15
We must position ourselves to continue inventing products that help deliver benefits to an overwhelming percentage of the global population We do that by maintaining deep longstanding relationships with our customers They rely on our expertise and unique capabilities which we can only offer by employing and retaining the best talent So when we ask people to join us we want them to spend their entire work lives at Corning We provide our people with many different experiences to enrich their careers and prosper By extension we take an active role in the communities where we work and live because we want our employees to enjoy them and we want their children to stay and join us as well Finally given our longterm focus we must always be working on discovering the next advancement that will power us for generations to come,8
Through this lens we see distinct opportunities to continue making a positive difference in this era through our products and through thoughtful actions involving every facet of our daytoday operations We recognize that Cornings proprietary manufacturing processes to melt glass and fire ceramics rely heavily on heat and water So it is our responsibility to find ways to navigate the global energy transition in the years ahead Thats why we continue to take meaningful steps in the right direction In October of 2021 we established new greenhouse gas reduction goals aligning with the Paris Agreement for Scope 12 emissions as well as major categories of Scope 3 emissions Well use power purchase agreements rather than carbon offsets We are working toward 100 renewable electricity usage in the United States Canada and Europe in the next few years Corning is also investing in product lifecycle assessments And our engineers and scientists are working on establishing fundamentally lowercarbon ways to manufacture glass an important step to reaching longterm net zero in the future,15
As we will detail in this years Sustainability Report the challenges,17
of 2021 did not deter us from our commitment to having a tangible impact in everything we do Let me give you some additional examples,12
We hosted COVID19 vaccination clinics at sites around the world including Mexico South Korea China and the US In Reynosa Mexico for example we helped administer well over 100000 doses of vaccines and boosters to employees and community members And weve provided more than 200000 diagnostic tests for employees around the world,9
We kicked off a fiveyear 55,4
million partnership with the nations largest historically Black university North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University Our work will prepare students for STEM careers,8
We engaged our Board of,7
Directors to provide guidance and resources to our Office of Racial Equality and Social Unity utilizing our members diverse experience gender age and ethnicity to advance this new initiative,8
And finally we were a pioneer in the United States on gender pay equity and once we achieved 100 we applied the same groundbreaking approach on a global scale reaching all salaried employees We also expanded the reach of our DEI office with regional business councils,11
I feel good about our efforts to bolster equality inside and outside the company and our progress on our sustainability initiatives And as we do all of this we will progress together and advance our journey to become a better version of ourselves,3
Along these lines Ill leave you with a point of great inspiration to me 2022 has been designated by the United Nations as the International Year of Glass Were celebrating this amazing material not only for what it holds protects and makes possible but also for how delicate strong and infinite,12
its potential becomes when combined with creativity and vision In fact we are targeting applications across most of the UN Sustainable Development Goals which seek to solve the most important problems facing humanity and the planet today Glass is a limitless reservoir for scientists dreams It can revolutionize how we harness clean energy from the sun It can pull carbon out of thin air And it provides exciting solutions to power cleaner vehicles,24
The promise and potential of a material that begins with a simple grain of sand is nothing short of inspirational You can see why we believe Cornings greatest contributions are yet to come And thats saying a lot given our history Im confident that we will continue to do our part through whatever unknowable challenges and upheavals we confront because we will always be able to draw upon our ultimate strength the direct connection among our purpose our people and the interest of all our stakeholders,10

Success Depends on Support from our Stakeholders,10
Success Depends on Support from our Stakeholders,10
Few companies have a timetested track record of scientific research and innovation that is vital to improving lives and making a real difference in the world Corning is one of those companies Weve thrived for 170 years by continually finding new ways to help move the world forward,3
Nature of link between our actions and stakeholder impact,10
This approach started in our earliest days when our companys founders committed to scientific innovation in glassmaking Their philosophy was to let other companies stamp out drinking glasses bottles and plate glass windows Our people would focus on transformative technology such as developing a reliable railroad signal that could significantly reduce fatalities by eliminating a primary cause of train accidents or creating the heatresistant glass sleeve for Thomas Edisons light bulb and the process that would help bring electric light into every home,5
Our contributions across three centuries speak for themselves,10
Our PYREX petri dishes enabled the development of penicillin and our Corning glass jars enabled Jonas Salk to produce the polio vaccine Today our technology is helping scientists tap into the power of cell therapy to cure disease And our revolutionary pharmaceutical packaging portfolio has enabled the delivery of almost 5 billion doses of COVID19 vaccines,6
Corning has supplied the windows for every manned US spacecraft since NASA first orbited the earth in 1962 And building on our involvement with the Hubble Space Telescope and New Horizons Pluto Probe we played a major role in the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope,23
Weve driven a series of advancements in emissions,25
control solutions starting with our invention of the ceramic substrates used in catalytic converters which have prevented more than 4 billion tons of hydrocarbons 4 billion tons of nitrogen oxides and 40 billion tons of carbon monoxide from entering the atmosphere,25
We invented a process to mass produce TV picture,24
tubes helping make televisions find their way into millions of homes as the technology became affordable And we built on that innovation with the advent of LCD TVs our leadership in pristine and durable glass has driven widespread adoption of largesize highdefinition flatscreen TVs,24
Our technical glass has enabled the development,15
and advancement of the tablets laptops smartphones and wearables that have become ubiquitous in our daily lives all powered by our invention of lowloss optical fiber a technology that has revolutionized communication and entertainment by moving data at the speed of light,1
Success Depends on Support from our Stakeholders,10
Today in a world where technology underpins every facet of human life weve positioned ourselves at the center of major industry transformations Were helping build a world of communication and connection where infinite and ubiquitous bandwidth facilitates realtime information and ondemand connections a world where people can do more from their mobile device in the palms of their hands or even on their wrists a world in which large lifelike displays provide the window through which we access entertainment a world where cars are autonomous connected and increasingly green and a world in which we help facilitate the discovery and delivery of new medicines that are individualized effective and safe,2
In total these contributions reflect our mission delivering inventions that provide value to society Central to that mission are the positive symbiotic relationships we maintain with a diverse set of stakeholder groups We know our success is about more than what happens within our four walls to extend Cornings sustained ability to innovate as our primary source of value creation we require mutual support and success among our people partners communities investors society and future stakeholders In addition to simply being the right thing to do it makes logical sense that we work to provide value for all our stakeholder groups,3
Our deep commitment to each group has manifested in many forms over time The nature of the link between our actions and their impact on stakeholders is illustrated in the graphic on the previous page The largest impact we have on the world is enabled by our technology our inventions help deliver benefits to an overwhelming percentage of the global population through our products At the same time we make a more direct positive impact in many ways This applies to those we interact with regularly in the course of business For example we want our employees to join us for life so we offer opportunities to enrich their careers throughout their time with us We also want them to benefit from our vibrant communities so we take an active,10
role wherever we live and work This not only supports our longterm effort helping us retain great talent but also encourages their children to remain in the community and join us as well,10
Historical examples demonstrate the nature of our linkages magnitude of our impact and longevity of our commitment Half a century ago we began recruiting from Historically Black Colleges and Universities as well as building a pipeline of underrepresented students in engineering and technology fields Forty years ago we adopted a Total Quality program to drive errorfree results that meet customer requirements 100 of the time At the same time we commissioned Black Progress and Womens Issues Corrective Actions teams and appointed our first cultural diversity director And we established employee resource groups starting with the Society of Black Professionals and building from there to support our employees who are women Hispanic LGBTQ Native American Asian and veterans as well as people with disabilities Finally weve maintained a longstanding role in our communities which is perhaps most clearly evidenced by our many facilities that have manufactured vastly different products over time while employing multiple generations of people from the same area,8
In all our actions we seek to make it clear that Cornings commitment to our six stakeholder groups is ongoing and fundamental to who we are and what we do Thats why our sustainability journey does not have an endpoint As we work to become better versions of ourselves were measuring our progress against the longterm value we deliver to all of these groups,3
We know that when we succeed our stakeholders succeed Corning advances and grows when our stakeholders thrive And right now were especially excited about the many ways our innovations and investments will benefit future generations,3
HOW WE CREATE SHARED SUCCESS WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS,10
Our People The commitment and contributions of our employees are central to our ability to create value Advancing our leadership in and capturing synergies among our core technologies and proprietary manufacturing platforms requires deep insight and experience uniquely derived through apprenticeship at Corning Consequently developing and protecting our workforce is a top priority We value the unique contributions of each individual Our employee base consists of diverse nationalities races genders and opinions We ensure that all employees earn a living wage and we offer comprehensive career development combined with competitive compensation and benefits We intend that every employee has the opportunity to participate fully and develop to their highest potential,8
Success Depends on Support from our Stakeholders,10
Our Partners Corning is committed to strategic integrated and socially responsible relationships with our customers suppliers and commercial partners We have positioned ourselves to play a vital role in our customers value creation We help them advance important industry transformations that move the world forward made possible by our deep understanding of their needs combined with the relevance of our leadership capabilities,3
Our Communities Support begins with strong wage and benefit packages that help many families in each of our communities In addition we employ philanthropy volunteerism and investments to boost economies help businesses thrive and ensure rich cultural and educational opportunities for all residents wherever we operate For example the Corning Museum of Glass supports tourism and jobs while growing enthusiasm for glass and supporting intellectual artistic and scientific collisions that move our field forward And regional campaigns connect Corning and our communities through volunteerism For example during our week of service in EMEA Turkish employees rebuilt a kindergarten class employees in Berlin worked with a nonprofit to upgrade a safe space for children and a team in Poland held a virtual auction to raise funds for people in need,2
Our Investors Were maintaining an effective valuecreation strategy which is driven by our strong stewardship and leadership position in three highly relevant core technical capabilities and four proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms As we find new synergies among them we unlock disruptive innovations creating vibrant franchises that generate strong cash flow outperform competitors in sales and profits and lead industries for decades In turn we utilize our strong cash generation to invest in ongoing growth extend our leadership and return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases,4
Society Cornings greatest potential for improving lives is tied to our products and innovations We apply our core technologies and proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms to help solve some of societys most pressing challenges and our positive impact has been demonstrated across three centuries Our success stems from an aspiration to moving the world forward in everything we do And that extends to the implications of our actions including respecting and protecting human rights supporting racial justice activities bolstering communities improving the environment and protecting our employees,10
Future Stakeholders At Corning were working every day to maximize our positive longterm impact on the world through our lifechanging products and stakeholderoriented initiatives while working to eradicate any potential negative impact on a range of areas from the environment to our supply chains Importantly Corning stands out among peers and large companies for the percentage of revenue we dedicate toward the future This approach is inherent in our goal of providing lasting and longterm value to society Were investing today in technology capital projects and sustainability initiatives designed to benefit our next generation of employees customers shareholders and community members,17
Success Depends on Support from our Stakeholders,10

Delivering Value Through our Products and Technologies,15
Helping Speed Delivery of COVID19 Vaccines,15
At Corning we invent lifechanging technologies using materials science With our portfolio of drugpackaging products we are expanding the vital role Corning plays in supporting critical health care demand globally,15
In 2021 Corning accelerated its advanced glass vial production capacity to support pharmaceutical manufacturers working to deliver hundreds of millions of doses of potentially lifesaving vaccines This included the introduction of Corning Velocity Vials an externally coated vial that can help drugmakers accelerate the manufacturing of COVID19 vaccines to help meet global demand The vials patented coating can improve filling line efficiency by 20 to 50 which can lead to lower pharmaceutical production costs Compared with conventional vials Velocity Vials resist damage that can lead to particle generation cracks and breaks,24
Velocity Vials can help eliminate bottlenecks and speed delivery of lifesaving treatments at a broadly accessible price point They aid in delivering a fast regulatory approval process for postmarket drugs and product benefits that can deliver better economics better quality and better sustainability,4
In 2021 Velocity Vials together with Corning Valor Glass vials and pharmaceutical glass tubing helped enable the delivery of nearly 5 billion doses of COVID19 vaccines,6
Were at an inflection point in the COVID19 response At this critical moment every vaccination counts which means every vial we deliver counts,9

HELPING THE WORLD BREATHE EASIER,10
In 2021 the World Health Organization tightened its Air Quality Guidelines for the first time in more than 15 years highlighting the environmental and health risks associated with even low levels of exposure to fine particulate matter like PM25 Highperformance gasoline engines that meet the fuel economy and efficiency needs of todays drivers also produce higher levels of these fine particulate emissions Building on decades of experience in particulate filtration for diesel vehicle exhaust Corning first introduced gasoline particulate filters in 2016 to reduce fine particulate matter emissions from gasoline engines A recently released new generation of these filters enables automakers to further,21
reduce gasoline and hybrid vehicles particulate tailpipe emissions under almost all driving conditions as regulatory limits continue to tighten Cornings ceramic filters trap fine particulates on the microscopic engineered porous,21
walls as engine exhaust flows through the filter Depending on the particulate matter levels in some communities,21
filtered gasoline exhaust can be cleaner than the ambient air,21
Corning is also a leading supplier of ceramic substrates for emissions control Since their introduction in 1973 Cornings ceramic substrates have prevented more than 4 billion tons of hydrocarbons 4 billion tons of nitrogen oxides and 40 billion tons of carbon monoxide from entering the atmosphere,21
In 1970 our breakthrough discoveries in optical fiber helped unleash a communications revolution that continues to change the world Cornings invention of lowloss optical fiber has allowed for high bandwidth long reach and lower power communications infrastructure enabling the internet as we know it today,1
In Uganda electricity demand has been growing at an average of 10 per year but the supply remains constrained as a mere 7 of rural Ugandan communities are connected to the electricity grid and able to access information and communication technologies ICT For schools and health clinics in rural areas reliable electricity and internet connectivity are especially critical,24
In a project with the development agency GIZ the Rural Electrification Agency and ADVA Optical Networking SE Corning helped to bring electricity and fiber to the remote village of Buheesi in western Uganda The project was part of a pilot to help explore solutions for Ugandas longstanding energy and connectivity access challenges The proposed solution was the rollout of electricity distribution lines and fiber optic cable creating a virtuous circle enabled by aerial cabling and employing an ICT ecosystem,24
Corning provided 72fiber aerial cable for the project as well as inline closures terminal closures and small wall terminals for termination inside the buildings For the pilot aerial fiber optic installation offered an important alternative to traditional underground installation methods and allowed for the fast and cost effective deployment of fiberto thehome connections Corning technicians also provided training on how to install and manage the fiber to ensure longterm reliability,24
Today thanks to the project the village is connected and the pilot has demonstrated proof of concept for expansions of rural infrastructure networks across the country In and beyond Africa deployment of aerial cables will be essential in reaching remote and rural areas,24
It was a privilege to support the ambitious efforts of our many partners and build the business case for driving connectivity in remote areas through shared infrastructure with ample opportunities to replicate this model in other locations it could have a big part to play in democratizing the global digital revolution,1

DRIVING TOWARD A NEW AUTOMOTIVE FUTURE,15
The most innovative automakers are focusing design differentiation on displays with nextlevel improvements from simple to interactive small to large low to high resolution and flat to curved Precision cover glass for displays is increasingly a material of choice as it maintains tactile feel enhanced touch sensitivity and beautiful aesthetics consumers have come to know and expect from their handheld devices Cornings flexible glass and patented Corning ColdForm Technology are helping automakers achieve design objectives and meet sustainability targets within their supply chains,15
Traditionally shaping glass is done by hot forming meaning additional energy is used to reheat the glass and mold or form it into its final shape By contrast Cornings patented ColdForm Technology uses optimized processes to bend and hold glass into its final shape at room temperature at the end of the moduleassembly process This proprietary process ensures each step in manufacturing from chemical strengthening to application of decoration and optical coatings and finally to shipping is all done with flat pieces of glass versus shaped glass which effectively reduces cost and energy spend By completing the manufacturing process in its flat state Cornings finished glass part improves yields reducing customers waste and material footprints,19
Corning recognizes that design differentiation doesnt just have an impact on price and materials but also on the environment To measure this impact Corning worked with a leading independent third party to conduct a lifecycle assessment LCA on ColdForm Technology An LCA measures environmental impacts from the manufacture and use of a product such as emissions released and waste created An LCA looks at each stage of the products life raw materials extraction and processing the supply chain material transportation manufacturing transport to the customer assembly installation use and disposal Every product has an impact and each life cycle stage can contribute,15
The assessment found that ColdForm Technologys global warming potential is about 25 less than traditional hotforming technology Because forming doesnt happen until the last step before assembly with a display and structural components processing is materials space and energy efficient this efficiency leads to better performance at the plant,24
Global warming potential relates directly to carbon footprint Using the EPAs greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator the difference between the carbon footprint of 1 million square feet of glass using Corning ColdForm Technology vs traditional hotforming methods equates to,25
33800000 miles driven in a passenger car,24
222500 tree seedlings grown for 10 years,2
Assumptions for the comparative analysis of the hot form process assume similar geographical region and were collected through expertise from inhouse hot forming for other types of automotive glass industry research expert opinions and thirdparty evaluations Models for the hot form process are representative of theoretical data Sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for the potential variances in environmental impact that could occur based on the collection of primary data for the hot form process,3
Corning is taking climate action by setting goals to lower our greenhouse gas GHGs emissions increase our use of renewable electricity and engage our partners in lowering the embodied carbon in the products they supply us,25
But our most powerful contributions to climate action will come from our innovation portfolio,13
Even as our subsidiary Hemlock Semiconductor Operations HSC produces more for todays cSi solar cells Corning is working with a partner in the development stages of using flexible glass as a substrate for nextgeneration solar enabling,15
rolltoroll solar cell printing higher efficiencies and lower costs We are also exploring nextgeneration cover glass for solar modules with the potential to reduce weight and increase light transmission and therefore module efficiency,24
Solar electricity alone will not solve climate change Corning is working on technologies to enable many of the new products the world will need to reduce global GHGs Our thin lightweight window glass can reduce energy waste through better insulation New technology based on LCD TVs may lead to instantaneously darkening windows that reduce HVAC load Ribbon ceramic materials,13
and polysilicon from Hemlock may enable higher density clean energy storage through batteries carbon free fuel or even completely new forms of energy generation see box below Our expertise in extrusion and ceramics is being leveraged by a partner to directly capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,24
Whether due to these materials or others that Corning scientists develop we believe our innovations aimed at climate action have the power to both drive our growth and reduce global GHG emissions by many times more than just erasing our total footprint,25
We are leveraging our expertise in inorganic materials chemistry and processing to develop ceramic ribbons that are less than a tenth of a millimeter thick and arbitrarily long Applications could include,15
Solidstate lithium batteries which offer higher capacities and greater safety compared with todays battery technology,14
Electrolysis cells for green hydrogen production which can significantly reduce global carbon emissions,25
Fusion reactors where hightemperature superconductors are critical for plasma containment which could provide essentially limitless energy to combat climate change,13
At Corning our approach to sustainability is grounded in our focus on the environmental social and governance ESG topics that matter most to our business and to our stakeholders We have integrated sustainability into our valuecreation model and embedded it into how we implement our strategic priorities across the enterprise,3
A Discussion with Our Vice President of Sustainability and Climate Initiatives,13
Corning headquarters building Corning New York,6
A DISCUSSION WITH OUR VICE PRESIDENT OF SUSTAINABILITY AND CLIMATE INITIATIVES,13
Sustainability at Corning means our stakeholders working together to ensure they all receive the benefits of another 170 years of our innovations Its a definition that encompasses but is less familiar and more durable than those items we all tend to group under environmental social and governance in todays common parlance Our definition highlights the fact that we serve the future as well as the present It reminds us that we have demonstrably successful practices to guide us It also charges us with the reality that sustainability requires constant work And we have been working We have enhanced our climate change goals and increased our capacity to address sustainability issues across the company Our customers see our commitment and are increasingly asking to partner with us to solve their own sustainability challenges We now have dedicated sustainability leads in each of the MarketAccess Platforms under which we organize our companys operations creating greater alignment across our businesses and functions We have established a Center of Excellence focused on setting and attaining future sustainability goals We also actively engage our entire leadership team beginning with our CEO to challenge assumptions and provide oversight on our performance We are able to identify emerging opportunities empower our people to drive progress and achieve results more quickly Our commitment to sustainability at Corning has never been stronger and I am excited both by the progress weve made and the progress I see coming,13
Mark Steen PhD Vice President of Sustainability and Climate Initiatives,13
Q What does sustainability mean to you,3
MS Sustainability means balancing the ways we serve our stakeholders so they continue to enable and benefit from our success As weve described in this report we have six categories of stakeholders our people partners communities investors society and future stakeholders Each group contributes a part of what we need to invent make and sell our life changing products In turn we give back the benefits of our actions to those same groups Sustainability for us means making that exchange in ways that allow more and more people to participate in enabling and enjoying a cleaner and safer world made possible by glass,15
When I reflect on Cornings sustainability practice over the last 17 decades it inspires me to remember that hundreds of thousands of people have contributed directly and billions of people have benefitted accomplishments that not many companies can match Many factories weve built have housed jobs in communities for multiple generations even as the products made in them have changed entirely We have decadeslong relationships with customers Our investors have changed from a small group mostly in,15
one family who held their shares for over a century to millions of people participating through large institutional funds And our products have served society through waves and waves of new technology Railroad signal lanterns large optical telescopes fiberglass cookware tube TVs and photosensitive glass for printing presses were all cuttingedge advances in their time and we helped make them possible,15
While the number of people enabling and enjoying the benefits of our work has grown dramatically over the years we can do more and we can do better All of our stakeholders will benefit as we increase the diversity of our people and partners Our communities will improve as we encourage and reward our employees more for their volunteer efforts Our investors will appreciate our increased clarity about our sustainability efforts Our society and future stakeholders look to us to reduce the water we use and the greenhouse gas we emit and to create innovations that help stop and even reverse climate change Improving on all of these dimensions and more is the sustainability work we have to do now,13
Q How is Corning strengthening the integration of sustainability,3
into its business priorities and daytoday operations,3
MS Relative to business priorities Id say our engagements with customers are becoming significantly more focused on sustainability topics Many of our closest partners have begun to recognize the opportunities for coinnovation and improving our combined impact We are finding ways to reduce the embodied carbon in our current products expanding our efforts to design new products with sustainability in mind from the start and unleashing our most powerful tools our research development engineering capabilities to invent whole new categories of materials to solve issues like connecting underserved populations and reducing atmospheric greenhouse gases Working to innovate with our suppliers and customers is certainly the broadestreaching measure we have to enhance global sustainability on both the environmental and social side,15
As for daytoday operations sustainability awareness good governance and empowered action are increasing at all levels of the company Cornings Board of Directors has revised our Social Responsibility and Sustainability Committee charter to clearly define the Boards responsibilities and increased oversight on,7
policies trends and risks impacting our environmental sustainability initiatives They are challenging us to among other things constantly find ways to improve safety accelerate our progress on DEI reduce energy and natural resource consumption and minimize waste across our operations We have some work to do here our water and waste measurements are not where we want them to be for instance but we believe we will make meaningful progress this year We also appointed dedicated sustainability leads in each of our Market Access Platforms to create greater alignment across the enterprise Our people are also expressing their heightened interest in sustainability So in 2021 a group came together to form the Corning Sustainability Network a grassroots effort to raise awareness of the companys sustainability work among our people as well as to develop paths for employees to add their energy to that work in both less and more formal ways Its a fledgling effort and well see where it goes but Im excited that our people are proactive in expressing their passion about sustainability,15

Q What do you most want to emphasize about sustainability at Corning,15
We started learning to manufacture fiber before there was a single customer and then supported the first telecom carrier willing to take the risk of building an entirely new nationwide telephone network No one imagined then the need for fiber to enable 5G wireless networks and 10G broadband access as we seek to expand connectivity for remote learning and telework We are purposeful in our approach to innovation and that same sense of purpose extends to any other problem or challenge we tackle While we dont have all the answers to environmental sustainability for instance our teams of scientists and engineers are working every day to understand how to solve for them such as getting to net zero,3
Despite our long history its hard to imagine weve ever had as many exciting potential innovations as we do today On a daily basis I hear about and get to contribute to work were doing to improve clean energy battery storage clean fuels negative emissions rural connectivity and more Thats a great part about being Corning We get to work on products that improve sustainability not just for our own company but for the world We like everyone must constantly improve the sustainability of our own actions whether through equitable pay community involvement wellpaid jobs or lowerGHG processes But we also get to do what so few other companies can make products that actually move the sustainability needle for society Innovation is hard and not all of these ideas are going to work but its thrilling to be a part of the effort,15
Stay tuned I think sustainability at Corning is going to be exciting both within our walls and well beyond them,12
MS Two related things our explicit recognition of future stakeholders and the potential of our innovation portfolio,3
Some people are confused that we list future stakeholders among our other more commonly encountered stakeholder groups I understand why it seems odd but it is very Corning For years our actions have demonstrated our deep commitment and dedication to taking the long view whether through investing nearly twice as much as our peers in RD or HR policies that encourage and achieve long careers with Corning or myriad other ways For example we make significant investments in STEM education programs in our communities to ensure we have a strong pipeline of future scientists inventors and engineers who want to make meaningful change on the world through their work Some of those trade offs mean that we take less today to ensure we can provide more for our stakeholders tomorrow That may seem like common sense I suppose it is but in the real world of immediate demands and rapid decision making its easy to shortchange the power and potential of the future So Im glad we have the clear reminder that the future must be considered,3
The second thing Ill emphasize is our innovation portfolio we have innovated to improve the world for a long time I mentioned the railroad signal lamp lenses we used to make in the 1800s What was innovative about them was that they didnt break when they were hot and got hit by cold rain or snow Signal lamps were especially important when operators couldnt see well like during rain and snowstorms so that was an important safety innovation for a major form of transportation at the time And we have made it a practice to innovate in anticipation of opportunity in emerging industries rather than only investing when the need is clearer and the payoff is more assured,13
Thats a great part about being Corning We get to work on products that improve sustainability not just for our own company but for the world,15
Mark Steen PhD Vice President of Sustainability and Climate Initiatives,13

OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT APPROACH,3
environmental performance to our Boards Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Committee,10
Our Global Energy Management GEM program within Cornings Manfacturing Technology and Engineering MTE organization manages our global energy use to optimize energy productivity power supply reliability and environmental impact while also managing water waste and emissions Our environmental strategy is based on GEMs mission for Corning to be a responsible user of energy water and other natural resources,24
Corning is always searching for ways to reduce energy and natural resource consumption and minimize waste at every step of our operations in our research labs our manufacturing plants and our offices,19
Our goal is to design and manufacture products with less environmental impact throughout their life cycles from concept design and material choices through sourcing manufacturing customer use and ultimately end of life In 2022 Corning Life Sciences and Corning Optical Communications will pilot designfor sustainability methods to define and embed sustainability advancements across the entire product life cycle,15
Our approach is guided by our Environmental Policy which outlines our commitment to operate in an environmentally responsible manner while complying with and striving to exceed all applicable laws regulations and company standards Our global product development teams are responsible for environmental compliance and use our environmental management system based on the principles of the global standard ISO 14001 to track environmental data and help ensure regulatory compliance Cornings director of sustainability global environment Global Energy Management and capital project management provides annual updates on our,12
Global Energy Management GEM strives to continuously improve reliability efficiency and productivity to make customers and the company more competitive and to support healthier communities around the world,24
GEM USES A FIVEPRONGED APPROACH,0
Continuously improve energy water and natural resource management in operations,20
Incorporate energy water and naturalresource innovation in product development product design and manufacturing processes,15
Engage employees and suppliers in energy water and naturalresource management,20
Ensure Corning meets customer requirements regarding energy water and naturalresource utilization,20
Analyze and communicate Cornings progress and success in energy water and naturalresource innovation to internal and external stakeholders,20
We continually work to identify and implement new approaches to energy efficient technologies and energy diversification within our operations We also recognize energy and emissions impacts across our entire value chain and work with our suppliers and customers to enhance sustainable practices,24
We launched our Global Energy Management GEM program aligned with the US Environmental Protection Agency ENERGY STAR Guidelines for Energy Management in 2006 to create and execute effective energy strategies across our global operations Since then the program has grown to include energyconservation teams at every Corning manufacturing facility around the world This allows us to look at our energy and emissions management using a holistic approach,24
Understanding and Mitigating Climate Risks and Opportunities,13

In 2021 we engaged managementlevel personnel across Cornings five MarketAccess Platforms to understand which climaterelated risks were most relevant to their business units Using this feedback we identified seven climaterelated risks and two climaterelated opportunities see table and conducted an indepth scenario analysis to assess their potential impact on our business under two different climate scenarios,13
Business as Usual BAU We constructed this scenario using transition factors from the Current Policies Scenario from the International Energy Agencys IEA 2019 World Energy Outlook Report physical factors from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC aligned with RCP 85 and socioeconomic factors from Shared Socioeconomic Pathway SSP 5,13
15Degree 15D We constructed this scenario using transition factors from the Sustainable Development Scenario from IEAs 2019 World Energy Outlook Report physical factors from IPCCs draft Sixth Assessment Report aligned with RCP 19 and socioeconomic factors from SSP1,3
Carbon pricing and reporting obligations,12
Mandates on and regulation of existing products and services,15
Development of new products or services through RD and innovation,15
Use of loweremission sources of energy,24
The results of this analysis showed that in a scenario where the world continues on the current trajectory BAU the greatest risks to Cornings business are related to physical climate events including chronic changes in precipitation patterns and extreme weather events Cornings business is geographically diversified which can help reduce the potential impact of extreme weather events,13
Under the 15D scenario our analysis revealed that changing customer behavior and carbon pricing obligations are anticipated to have the greatest impact to our business We are actively engaging with customers to understand their sustainability and climaterelated needs and to find ways to support those needs,3
To reduce potential risk related to carbon Corning is accelerating efforts to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions We are also applying our capabilities to invent technologies that reduce carbon emissions and others that remove carbon from the air,21
Accelerating Climate Actions by Introducing CarbonReduction Goals,13
In 2021 using guidance developed by the Science Based Targets initiative SBTi Corning added two more goals to our list of climate commitments see page 23,13
Reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas GHG,25
emissions by 30 absolute basis by 2028 compared to a 2021 baseline Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction goal is in alignment with a 15C future scenario,25
Reduce our relevant Scope 3 emissions by 175,25
absolute basis by 2028 compared to a 2021 baseline Our Scope 3 GHG emissions reduction goal is in alignment with a wellbelow 2C future scenario,25
In 2021 Corning committed publicly to submitting these goals to SBTi This builds on our multiyear effort to address the impact of climate change efforts which in some cases span well over a decade Our efforts include,13
Increasing Use of Renewable Electricity Corning is one of the largest users of solar energy in the United States According to the most recent Solar Energy Industries Association report 2019 Corning ranked 18th among businesses in the United States and second within the manufacturing sector for corporate solar energy usage Corning has committed to a fourfold increase in our renewable electricity use 2018 baseline and is on a path to 100 renewable electricity in the next five to seven years in the United States Canada and Europe We are working with partners to solve the challenges of renewable electricity in Asia and our other locations and expect to greatly expand renewable electricity use in those geographies over the next decade,24
By investing in emerging technologies Corning is identifying ways to replace natural gas with lowcarbon fuel options to melt glass and fire ceramics We have also begun a program to identify and replace equipment that currently uses natural gas or high carbon fuel sources with electrical equipment powered with green electricity,24
Continuing Focus on Energy Efficiency Cornings energy management has been recognized by the US Environmental Protection Agency ENERGY STAR program for eight consecutive years Corning continues to optimize processes to reduce energy use invests in energy efficiency projects and communicates opportunities and best practices to all of our manufacturing facilities,24
Working with Suppliers to Reduce Upstream Emissions Corning has successfully engaged its suppliers on sustainability producing improved visibility and compliance such as increased social and environmental responsibility with mined material suppliers The companys supply chain organization has begun identifying and engaging with suppliers on GHG reductions For example multiple Corning businesses have reduced the distance traveled from suppliers to Corning manufacturing sites resulting in reduced transportation emissions,25
Innovation Process Cornings new product innovations are increasingly focused on reducing embodied carbon in our products and our customers products and operations Corning is working with multiple customers across our MarketAccess Platforms to deliver those customers GHG reduction goals Several customers have selected Corning to be part of their leading group of vendors to jointly develop the customers supply chain GHG reduction programs Corning has begun to use lifecycle assessments performed by third parties to provide industryrecognized calculations of embodied carbon The company is also developing GHGimpact estimates to be used in the earlystage design of our products,25
For more information on our climaterelated efforts see our Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosure TCFD report page 74,13
ENERGY STAR Leader 8 YEARS and Counting,24
We continually work to identify and implement new approaches to energy In 2021 the EPA named Corning an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year for the eighth consecutive year and recognized us for Sustained Excellence for the sixth consecutive year In addition six of our global manufacturing facilities received the ENERGY STAR Challenge for Industry recognition by each exceeding the goal of improving energy efficiency by at least 10 in five years or less,24
Cornings global manufacturing facilities have received the ENERGY STAR Challenge for Industry recognition 43 times since 2014 In 2021 six sites were recognized,15
These honors recognize not only Cornings yearround dedication to energy efficiency but also the integral role that the ENERGY STAR program plays in our enterprisewide environmental efforts,24
Global Energy Management GEM measures its program against ENERGY STARs 23 Guidelines for Energy Management and encourages all energy team members around the world to use ENERGY STAR resources We also use ENERGY STAR guidelines as a framework to develop our water and waste programs,24
In 2021 a crossfunctional team with representatives from Cornings energy finance procurement and enterprise risk departments came together to develop a more streamlined approval process for renewable energy projects to fasttrack renewable energy action within the company Recognizing the potential for crosssector improvement the project achieved recognition as Cornings fifth consecutive ENERGY STAR Top Project The company is now sharing the process with other ENERGY STAR partners to help them achieve similar efficiencies,24
Our Sustained Investment in Solar Energy,24
2015 Corning financed a North Carolina solar energy production facility by entering into a 25year power purchase agreement which produces approximately 105000 megawatt hours of electricity assigned to Corning each year,24
2018 Corning joined Apple one of our major customers and nine other Apple suppliers to jointly invest 300 million by 2022 in the China Clean Energy Fund The fund will invest in and develop projects totaling more than 1 gigawatt of renewable energy in China the equivalent of powering nearly 1 million homes,24
2019 We added solar installations to three Corning Life Sciences facilities Wujiang China Amsterdam Netherlands and Oneonta New York US In total these solar arrays will help avoid 35 million pounds of greenhouse gas emissions annually,25
2020 Corning signed a longterm power purchase agreement for our Canton New York facility enabling a new offsite solar array to be built within the Riverview Solar Technology Park in Tonawanda New York,24
2021 The Riverview Solar Technology Park began operations along with three new community solar projects in Dix Orange and Plattsburgh New York By supporting local renewable projects Corning is doing more than mitigating our own carbon footprint were serving as a committed and major offtaker helping to reduce the developers risk in these local renewable energy projects,24
2021 Site Highlights Renewable Energy Initiatives,24
Anhui China Corning collaborated with BOE one of our largest customers to install thousands of solardistributed photovoltaic power stations on the rooftop of our Gen 105 display glass manufacturing facility in Hefei China The solar panel processing area extends approximately the length of three soccer fields and is designed to produce nearly 25 million kilowatthours of power each year,24
Hainan China Corning installed solar panels that can generate clean electricity for the plant office reducing the amount of energy the site will need to source from the power grid,24
Harrodsburg Kentucky US Corning is part of Apples Supplier Clean Energy Program which is designed to advance the use of renewable energy throughout the companys supply chain and is an integral part of Apples efforts to become carbon neutral by 2030 As part of that commitment Corning has deployed multiple cleanenergy solutions including installation of a solar panel system at our Harrodsburg facility,24
Taiwan Corning continued to supply customer AU Optronics AUO with solar energy from solar panels on the roofs of our two manufacturing facilities AUO rents the roof space from Corning and sells generated power back to the Taiwan Power Company a stateowned electricity utility,24
To further reduce the carbon footprint associated with the solar supply chain Corning prioritizes the use of ultralowcarbon solar panels which contain up to 50 less embodied carbon than typical solar panels in large part due to the advantaged polysilicon produced by Hemlock Semiconductor Operations HSC Cornings stake in HSC increased to 805 in 2020,17
Embedding Sustainability Across the Product Life Cycle,15
Our Optical Communications business calculated cradletograve carbon footprint data for several of its new Data Center and FTTx factory terminated cable and connectivity solutions using the Life Cycle Assessment methodology in accordance with ISO 14040 and 14044 International Standards These assessments showed that our innovations have lower carbon footprints than our legacy solutions In 2022 we will continue using this methodology to support our customers GHG reduction programs identify sustainability enhancements and develop GHG impact estimates for earlystage innovation programs,25

From our manufacturing floors to our corporate offices were constantly working to preserve one of natures most precious resources water,20
Fresh water is vital to our direct manufacturing operations While the majority of Corning manufacturing facilities use local public water supply in their operations certain manufacturing sites require access to industrial water,20
All Corning manufacturing sites are certified to ISO 140012015 and use environmental management systems to track water withdrawal discharges and consumption and to identify ways to improve water efficiency and quality We aggregate at the corporate level the volume of all water we discharge to municipal sanitary systems to assess yearoveryear wateruse patterns Individual sites track discharges to other destinations and to other discharge quality as required by local regulations Where possible we recycle industrial wastewater for use in our manufacturing process,20
Corning plans for business growth in the coming years which could require increased fresh water in our direct and indirect operations We are working to offset this future demand through wateruse reduction projects in our direct operations today with a focus on manufacturing plants located in areas of high water stress,20
We assess water risk as part of our enterprise risk management ERM assessment process every two years using the World Resource Institutes Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool and the support of external consultants We conducted our last assessment in 2020 finding that 17 of our operating facilities are located in high or extremely high stressed waterscarce regions of the world In 2021 we prioritized our waterreduction efforts on these facilities initiating watersaving activities in four of our top 10 waterconsuming plants,20
For more information we will be publishing our response to CDPs Water Security program in summer 2022 In the disclosure we will detail how we use water across our global operations and how we manage associated water risks and opportunities,20
Less than 10 of Cornings water withdrawal is in waterstressed regions,20
With water scarcity becoming a critical issue globally were committed to improving our product design and manufacturing processes to reduce water use in our direct operations and throughout our supply chain Our teams around,20
the world are implementing measures to reduce water usage to creatively clean and purify water and to recycle it These efforts are not,20
only reducing our use of water but also saving Corning money,20
Canton New York US A team saw an opportunity to improve how we sample water in our pump house system and reduce water use The Canton team significantly curtailed time spent in a backwash mode during which water is drained from the system The result The time to sample water decreased and water was saved,20
Wilmington North Carolina US We developed ways to recycle water to support operations at our optical fiber plant located in a waterstressed region,20
Reynosa Mexico We corrected water leaks in a reverseosmosis system saving water consumed in this waterstressed region,20
Port Elizabeth South Africa Nearly half the sites water consumption is from collected rainwater,20
We are committed to data assurance The last year for which we have assured water data is 2020 below We are working to improve our data collection methodology and are committed to evolving disclosure in future reports,22
Assumptions Thirdparty sources make up majority of water withdrawal at 67 and 68 for 2019 and 2020 respectively Warehouses and contract manufacturers are excluded from water withdrawal information,20
Were committed to responsibly managing waste produced both in our direct operations and throughout our supply chain We use strategies such as increased diversion from landfills and overall waste minimization while adhering to federal state local and provincial waste laws and regulations,19
We are also implementing the principles of a circular economy by managing product design and reducing reliance on raw materials through increased use of recycled and recyclable materials,15
Our newproduct development teams seek to invent products that incorporate recycled material without compromising quality performance or appearance Sometimes that involves finding uses for materials previously considered to be waste Looking to the future we see the need for more circular manufacturing where waste is minimized resources are reused and used products are repurposed,19
What is a Circular Economy,4
A circular economy is a model of production and consumption which involves sharing leasing reusing repairing refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible The process addresses global challenges like climate change biodiversity loss waste and pollution by emphasizing designbased implementation of the three base principles of the model eliminating waste and pollution circulating products and materials and the regeneration of nature,19
In 2021 we continued efforts to develop our formal waste strategy For example working with the New York State Pollution Prevention Institute we determined a wastemeasurement methodology and baseline waste generation status and identified best practices In 2022 we plan to continue assessments of global Corning manufacturing plants prioritized by the types and opportunities of their waste streams and develop future waste reduction targets for Cornings business divisions,19
Corning recycles waste glass from our manufacturing processes back into our products We also work with outside vendors to recycle glass that cannot meet our high quality standards so the material can have a new life,15
Reduced waste by returning wooden pallets to suppliers for reuse In 2021 the site was recognized with a Green Label Certificate for its efforts,19
Eliminated the use of polypropylene reels for fiber optic terminals used for fibertothehome In addition to reducing singleuse plastics this also enabled the site to increase the number of reels per pallet resulting in less consumption of wood while optimizing transportation,24
Created a more efficient packaging method for multiple 192fiber optical cable assemblies and EDGE Modules for Data Center solutions This reduced the use of corrugated cardboard plastic packaging and wooden pallets while optimizing transportation costs,15
Corning and Verizon Establish Program to Recycle Shipping Reels,15
